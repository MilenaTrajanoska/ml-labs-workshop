"The concept of “going green” sounds good on paper. Companies across the globe are setting goals to operate more efficiently by balancing sustainability with affordability.
But how many of these businesses are actually pulling it off? What companies are walking the walk and not just talking the talk? What brands are creating technology that is sustainable and affordable?
As the global economy struggles and a potential recession looms, truly “green” companies operating a sustainable (both environmentally and fiscally) business model will begin to stand out compared to the pretenders. As we head through 2023, here are several green tech companies that are coming through on their promise to help build a sustainable yet affordable tech-powered future.
1. PosiGen Is Making Solar Power Accessible
As the idea of solar power has slowly inched toward reality, one of the ongoing issues has been upfront costs — expenses that are disproportionately felt by certain groups more than others. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) has reported that low-income households, as well as those of ethnic minorities such as Black, Native American, and Hispanic homes, pay a disproportionately high share of their income on their energy bills.
In contrast, even with government incentives (many of which lower and moderate-income households don’t qualify for), a solar panel system can easily run into thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars. Even if it has the potential to save a home more than its cost over its lifespan, the upfront investment to buy a system puts this green energy option firmly out of reach for many homes.
Enter PosiGen. PosiGen offers solar energy system leases to homeowners, designs them based on a customer’s utility usage, and does not require a minimum income level or credit score. This removes the immediate capital burden of each installation.
ACEEE also highlights home weatherization as a way for homeowners to reduce energy burdens by as much as 25%. PosiGen has an answer for this as well, as it provides a complimentary home energy audit and certain energy efficiency upgrades along with each solar installation, further enhancing each household’s savings.
2. Soluna Is Recycling Solar Power
Sticking with the renewable energy theme, solar and wind power are all the rage now. And yet, the renewable energy industry is still finding its footing.
Blades from wind turbines represent a growing pollution threat. Unpredictability in weather patterns can make financing and paying debts difficult for wind and solar farm owners. Critically, inconsistent revenue and negative pricing periods are chaotic at best and often lead to wasted electricity. (A devastating reality for an industry built around sustainability).
Soluna Computing is a tech company that is answering the issue of excess energy — and even redirecting it to solve a separate yet related issue: cryptocurrency mining. The digital “mining” of cryptocurrency has come under fire for its wasteful use of resources for years now.
Soluna’s reclamation of excess solar and wind power is used to run data centers that sell clean computing power to its customers — including cryptocurrency miners. This is another key example of balancing sustainability with affordability. It’s the definition of efficiency and a clear “two birds with one stone” win for the sustainable tech sector.
3. Sendle Is Making Shipping Carbon Neutral
If there’s one iconic image that represents the ongoing environmental damage taking place around the world on a daily basis, it has to be the picture of large trucks rumbling down the road. Exhaust and fumes, consumption of fossil fuels, and the sheer number of vehicles in operation on the road are alarming.
Sendle is one delivery brand that is working hard to remedy the unsustainable damage done by transportation. The tech company has created a software platform that small business owners can use to gain easy access to cost-effective and flexible shipping options.
Along with its primary focus on moving goods between different endpoints, Sendle is also fiercely committed to a sustainable philosophy — a tall order in its industry. Nevertheless, the brand consistently promises that each delivery is 100% carbon neutral.
This lofty goal is accomplished in multiple ways. For instance, Sendle software charts the most efficient path for each package, ensuring that extra emissions aren’t in transit. In addition, the company invests in positive environmental initiatives to offset the carbon that its carriers do create in the process of doing their jobs. Needless to say, this company is not only balancing sustainability with affordability, but it’s making shipping more convenient as well.
4. Bowery Farming Is Reducing Agricultural Waste
Tech influences every industry today — and the food industry is no exception. From farming to distribution to cutting-edge crops, technology is reimagining life for a planet that has always struggled with hunger.
The only problem is that many of the technologies currently in use tend to be harmful to the environment. From gas-guzzling tractors to earth-damaging fertilizers to chemically-disrupted ecosystems, farming in the 21st century can be as destructive as it is beneficial.
It’s an issue that Bowery Farming is working overtime to address. The sustainably-focused farming company is utilizing food technology to create controlled indoor agricultural hubs just outside of major urban centers. This generates affordable food while addressing a variety of environmental concerns, such as a lack of arable land and water waste.
5. Boundless Offers Clean, Sustainable, Hydrogen-Backed Health
Hydrogen is a popular item for many sustainable initiatives. One unexpected area where entrepreneurs are putting the essential element to good use is the growing health obsession with hydrogen water.
Hydrogen water is a health beverage that combines hydrogen with water and offers a variety of benefits. The process of combining these ingredients can be tricky, though, and often involves chemical processes, such as electrolysis.
Boundless Hydrogen Water has found a cleaner way to manufacture its hydrogen water: through hydrokinetic ultrasonic fluid mixing. (i.e., using sound waves to naturally combine the ingredients.) In addition, the brand only uses green hydrogen obtained from sustainable sources. The result is a healthy, affordable product that is as good for the planet as it is for people.
From food to shipping, solar power, and even cryptocurrency, there are countless tech companies that are creating a real, tangible difference in the environment. As the “green gospel” continues to infatuate all and sundry, the world needs to learn from these leaders in the green tech space. Making a difference and preserving our future is more than a cute mission statement or setting aside a budget for sustainability efforts. It requires thoughtful sustainability strategies executed with the passion and vision for a brighter future.

"Today companies know the importance of delivering meaningful Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies and action, in balance with their short-term commercial goals. If not done properly, driving through new ESG changes can create friction with stakeholders or even impact the business, creating real frustration for those tasked with making change happen.
For those with ESG responsibilities, whether they are senior leaders, sustainability officers, or even passionate employees, securing buy-in and navigating roadblocks is not easy. It's vital to bring others onboard with a vision and know how to have the right conversations to create change.
Coaching is a development practice that can help ESG professionals become more effective in their roles. The International Coaching Federation defines coaching as ""partnering in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires a person to maximize their personal and professional potential.""
Neil Scotton, a professional certified coach with the International Coaching Federation (ICF) and co-founder of the One Leadership Project, is interested in how organizations approach ESG and particularly why acting on ESG topics like climate, race, and gender can sometimes be slow-moving.
In his experience, pursuing an ESG goal requires a holistic, inclusive, and empathic view of an organization. For example, increasing women in senior leadership positions cannot be achieved if there are limited entry level roles, few promotions, and an unencouraging culture. Scotton has observed that the language used when discussing ESG topics can be confrontational. For instance, terms such as ""fight for…"" or ""battle with…"" are commonly used, which can automatically set a precedent for conflict and confrontation when dealing with stakeholders.
When working with senior leaders, Scotton finds it helpful to frame ESG policy making as a ""legacy"" issue, in the context of what we create and leave for others. Useful questions include: how do you want to be remembered? And contrastingly: how will you actually be remembered?
These questions are examples of a coaching approach helping teams and individuals see the task of implementing ESG goals from a bigger perspective and give them a stronger motivation to succeed. ""Coaching conversations enable people to take a step back and explore the many influences on successfully achieving ESG goals,"" Scotton said. ""For instance, people may want to assess the external factors to anticipate and plan for, plus internal politics, decision making, empowerment, and culture. It can be useful to identify who the key stakeholders, change agents and gatekeepers are that can facilitate change, and the support they need.
""Coaching is not just for executives and senior leaders but can be helpful to any employee working in an ESG setting. Coaching-style conversations can help ensure people across the organization are really engaged with making ESG happen — inclusive of all hierarchy positions, outlooks, ages, races, and genders.""
According to Scotton, employees at all levels can positively influence an organization's ESG policy, however many individuals struggle to translate their passion for change into meaningful action. These ""fire starters"" have a hunger to make a positive difference but can become overwhelmed by the task at hand. Coaching can empower these individuals, ensure they don't burn out, and help break down the issues at hand. Importantly, coaching can show passionate individuals how to work with the broader organization, rather than be in conflict with it.
""Speaking in a confidential and safe space is something people don't often experience at work and that's a powerful aspect of coaching,"" said Scotton. ""It's a place where you can have an honest confidential conversation, where you can deep-dive into complex themes and challenge yourself to come up with solutions that bring ESG goals to life."" For those interested in receiving coaching, it's important to do research and find an accredited coach with a reputable body.

"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In February, we’re exploring the people, places and journeys working to make tourism more sustainable.
For travelers who love to cruise but also consider themselves to be environmentally minded, the concept of “green” cruising can seem counterintuitive.
Indeed, sustainability challenges abound in an industry known for its carbon-spewing vessels, excess waste production (spanning trash, sewage, and gray water), and port overtourism – not to mention environmental violations that have resulted in well-publicized penalties.
However, as stricter regulations and global environmental benchmarks set in – and consumers increasingly demand cleaner, greener vacations – there are cruise companies out there that are putting the hard work into making at-sea experiences significantly more sustainable.
“Every cruise line is investing in green initiatives, from looking at carbon footprint to refining emissions. It is top of mind for each cruise line,” explains Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of cruise review website Cruise Critic.
And today, baseline sustainability practices like banning plastic straws or reusing linens simply aren’t enough to move the needle. The real innovators are the lines that are most aggressively chasing decarbonization goals via technological breakthroughs, especially around cleaner alternative fuels and greener infrastructure in port.
The cruise industry transported nearly 30 million passengers and contributed over $154 billion to the global economy pre-pandemic, in 2019; despite the hiccups of the pandemic, it’s on track to surpass those numbers by year’s end. Cruise proponents say that cruising can be a force for good, by supporting local economies and inspiring cruisers’ sense of environmental and cultural awareness.
Yet, the industry’s reliance on polluting heavy fuel oil (HFO) for its ships has put it at odds with the United Nations’ global net-zero emissions targets for 2050. Currently, cruise ships and other maritime vessels are responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse emissions each year. Considered to be worse than flying in terms of carbon emissions per passenger, a report by Pacific Standard revealed that a person’s average carbon footprint triples in size while on a cruise.
Ocean-going member cruise lines of Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest cruise industry trade association, have committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to reducing carbon rates by 40% by 2030 (as compared to 2008 levels).
As those goals are targeted, however, industry watchdogs say greenwashing abounds. “Many of the claims of sustainability are just greenwashing or are the same types of ‘sustainability’ measures that have been happening for years in land-based tourism,” says Marcie Keever, a director at environmental group Friends of the Earth, which puts out an annual cruise line “report card.”
Examples of this may be found as lines look to swap out carbon- and sulfur-emitting HFO for cleaner, alternative fuels. Lower-carbon liquefied natural gas (LNG) is being widely heralded as a “stepping stone” fuel solution, with more than half of the new cruise ships on order with CLIA members featuring LNG for their primary propulsion.
Yet, environmentalists and scientists caution that LNG it is a finite and polluting fossil fuel that may cause even more environmental damage than HFO long-term.
Simply put, “LNG is a dirty fuel,” says Dr. Mark Jacobson, director of the atmosphere/energy program at Stanford University, and author of “No Miracles Needed: How Today’s Technology Can Save Our Climate and Clean Our Air.” He says that while LNG’s “direct air pollution emissions are less than heavy fuel oil, they are still substantial – and its upstream emissions and footprint are larger than of heavy fuel,” owed to factors like unsustainable extraction practices (like fracking) and methane byproducts.
Experts like Jacobson say the industry’s focus should be more fully on emerging zero-emissions energy technologies. “The far cleaner solutions for ships are battery electricity and green hydrogen fuel cell electricity,” says Jacobson, citing that “in either case, all emissions from the ship – aside from water vapor in the case of hydrogen fuel cells–are eliminated.”
CLIA reports that more than 15% of cruise ships debuting in the next five years will be equipped to incorporate hydrogen fuel cells or electric batteries.
Another promising sustainability development is the industry’s move toward zero-emissions docking. The vast majority of today’s new ships are being designed with capabilities to power off their fuel-burning engines and plug into the local grid while in port – reducing air pollution and related health issues in the process. The caveat: Only 29 of the 1,500-odd ports visited by CLIA ships presently offer compatible infrastructure.
While there may be a long way to go yet – “cruising continues to be one of the dirtiest vacation choices,” cautions Keever – here are five cruise lines that are leading the pack with their eco-conscious initiatives.
Hurtigruten
This 130-year-old Norwegian adventure travel company incorporates a sustainability ethos at its core. A green-energy leader, Hurtigruten sidelined HFO for its small-ship fleet over a decade ago, in favor of alternative, greener fuels like marine gasoil and biofuels.
In 2019, they launched the world’s first hybrid battery electric-powered cruise ship (and are in the process of converting the rest of their expedition fleet to hybrid battery power), with plans for the world’s first zero-emissions cruise ship by 2030.
They’ve also enabled fleet-wide shore-power connectivity to eliminate emissions while in port, and were the first cruise company to phase out single-use plastics onboard.
Ponant
Luxury French line Ponant rolled out an emissions-slashing hybrid expedition ship (running on LNG and electric battery power), the 245-passenger Le Commandant Charcot, in 2021, and has plans for a “zero-impact” ship by 2025.
The first cruise line to achieve Green Marine certification, Ponant also offsets 100% of its emissions.
Plus, all Ponant ships are equipped with shore-to-ship power connections in port; the line has stopped using single-use plastics; and environmental impact studies are conducted before designing any itinerary.
Star Clippers
Sometimes, when it comes to sustainability, what’s old is new again.
Monaco-based sailing company Star Clippers operates a trio of tall 166- to 227-passenger sailing ships that operate exclusively on wind power up to 80% of the time (and utilize low-sulfur gas oil otherwise).
Small ship size means lesser overall impact, as well as access to less-touristed ports–in Costa Rica, for instance, Star Clippers was the first cruise line to be certified as “Pura Vida Pledge”-approved by the Costa Rican Tourism Board in recognition of their eco-credentials.
Havila Voyages
This 2022-debuted Norwegian cruise line has launched two of four planned hybrid ships, running itineraries along Norway’s coast.
Havila Voyages has the biggest passenger-ship batteries at sea, allowing their ships to voyage – for periods of up to four hours – into the country’s UNESCO-protected fjords, silently and emissions-free.
Plus, the batteries can be recharged in port with clean hydropower energy from the local grid, and are strong enough to power the ships while they’re docked. While the ships currently also use LNG power, Havila aims to ultimately run emissions-free, with vessels that’ve been designed to cross over to hydrogen power once the technology is available.
Explora Journeys
This new luxury cruise brand from Swiss-based shipping company MSC Group launches this summer, but will really make waves in 2027 when it debuts the world’s first LNG-powered vessel to feature hydrogen fuel cells, along with methane slip-reducing technology.
In partnership with Italian shipbuilders Fincantieri, Explora Journeys’ pioneering ships (the first that of two that are planned for the fledgling line) will have significantly reduced greenhouse emissions while at sea and emit little more than water vapor and heat when idle in port.
Other highlights for the brand include a single-use plastics ban and underwater noise reduction certification (as not to disturb marine wildlife)."
"The real passion of Gabriela Hearst, the creative director of the Parisian house of Chloé, is sustainability, not fashion. But she works in a luxury business where clothes and handbags pay bills and salaries. Can she balance the books between the environmental and business bottom lines?
It is this question, rather than what length skirts should be this season, that keeps Hearst up at night. “I never think about trends. If I hit a trend it’s a complete accident. I inherited my mum’s wardrobe, my daughters take their denim from me. Quality is everything. People ask why my clothes cost so much. It is because the fabric and construction will last your lifetime and beyond.”
Hearst landed the Chloé job two years ago, after making her name with a niche eponymous brand that schooled the 1% in the joys of deadstock fabric and cashmere recycling. Her mission at Chloé is to scale up aspirational sustainable fashion, and pull it off on the industry’s biggest stage, Paris fashion week.
“This is my favourite collection I’ve done for Chloé so far,” Hearst said backstage before the show.
She was wearing a double-breasted linen jacket, which was about to make its catwalk debut, finished with hammered gold buttons made by a social enterprise project in Kenya that provides artisans in impoverished communities with opportunities to work with global fashion brands.
The Chloé supermodel this season is the painter Artemisia Gentileschi – born 1593 – one of the few women who found success in the male-dominated world of Renaissance art.
“The climate emergency will need lots of different solutions, there’s no single answer. Female leadership is intrinsic to that path because women excel at elevating other people.”
The modern world needs to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, said Hearst, because “it is the artists and the scientist who will get us out of this mess – I don’t put too much faith in the politicians”.
Gentileschi loved clothes – she was known to incur debts by placing lavish orders for taffeta beyond her means – and the pearl earrings, portrait necklines and bishop sleeves on the catwalk could have stepped direct from her canvas. Capes and graphic silk ribbon striped suits also had a courtly air, but slinky cream ribbed dresses and black leather outerwear were thoroughly modern.
Hearst rejects the modish view of “vegan” leather as an environmentally friendly choice. “For as long as we are eating meat, leather is a byproduct of that,” she argued.
“So it is a good fabric to use. When I go home to my ranch in Uruguay they ask me – what’s happening in the north? They are having to burn leather, because people want to wear polyester instead. The idea that vegan shoes are helping the environment is just good marketing.”
New this season are QR codes in each garment, which identify and authenticate each piece, designed to facilitate and encourage a circular economy. In theory, they act as an invisible, everlasting version of the swing tags that hang in Chloé boutiques, so that the garment retains the cachet it had on the shop floor of a Chloé boutique, however many times it changes hands.
Secondhand shoppers will be reassured that a piece is genuine while women with Chloé clothes hanging in their wardrobes unworn will be motivated to sell those clothes on if they retain value.
Hearst and label CEO Riccardo Bellini are awaiting the result of profit-and-loss audits on the environmental and social impact of the company, which will measure the extent to which Chloé has succeeded in lowering its carbon footprint.
Bellini admits that there is a “constant trade-off” between Chloé’s business aspirations and its principles. Some 60% of fabrics used are “lower impact” materials, and Chloé no longer sells cotton T-shirts, to avoid the water-intensive production of that fabric.
Cashmere has been replaced by recycled cashmere, and denim by circular denim, which is made of a mix of recycled cotton and either hemp or linen.
But Hearst admits that, as a designer, she does not want customers to stop shopping. “My self-esteem is attached to sell-through,” she told Womenswear Daily recently."
"Amidst a global inflection point for business and society, the metaverse is beginning to scale. Seven in 10 executives said it would positively impact their organization; four in 10 consider it a breakthrough, as recently shown in an Accenture survey.
Industrial and product companies are among those placing big bets, and they have started to pay off. Take Siemens Energy, which reported that, through technological applications for maintenance and inspection, the metaverse reduced downtime by 70% and saved its steam turbine business $1.7 billion.
A natural extension of digital twins
What attracts companies to the metaverse? It’s the immersive environment it provides, where multiple users can interact, and easily accessible information can be layered in for objects, avatars and actions.
The big opportunity for industrial and product companies lies in coupling the collaborative, immersive, visual and intuitive dimensions of the metaverse with digital twins fed by integrated data pools across departments, systems, operations technology and IT.
Event
GamesBeat Summit 2023
Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.
This could create a virtual, fully immersive and intuitive simulation of the entire enterprise. Every aspect of it could be run through a plethora of eventualities, with each projected effect informing other scenarios.
In part, this opportunity is still nascent. But we found that increasingly, virtual data-based replicas of objects, facilities and processes play a role in four compelling metaverse use cases for industrial and product companies:
1: Creative collaboration and product development
In what is now being called the industrial metaverse, workers across departments can connect in an immersive environment that allows more efficient design, engineering, testing and validation. Employees can connect from anywhere to see interactive design simulations and operational scenarios.
For example, in Boeing’s factory of the future, immersive 3-D engineering designs will be twinned with robots that speak to each other, while mechanics around the world will be linked by HoloLens headsets.
Engineers can also prototype and test products virtually, which is cost-effective and more efficient than testing actual products in real-life scenarios. In the metaverse, prototypes can be set up quickly as digital simulations with engines like Unity. The result: More options for customers and a shorter creation process.
What is more, the metaverse gives engineers the opportunity to ’beam’ important stakeholders right into a simulated work environment. This is of particular value in complex and large-scale development projects, like ITER. More than 30 countries collaborated on building a large-scale electricity generation facility based on nuclear fusion.
Using NVIDIA Omniverse, Unreal Engine for Oculus, Bentley iTwin, and Azure Remote Rendering for HoloLens2, ITER virtually teleported people into the digital twin of the facility to experience it for the first time.
2. Maintenance and remote repairs
General Electric (GE), for its part, created a digital twin of its gas turbines using the metaverse to continuously optimize the temperature and send automatic adjustments to the controls. These gas turbines require seasonal adjustment, often a manual process performed by an expert after an outage that may take multiple days.
Not only does the metaverse decrease time and manual labor, but it enhances performance by monitoring temperatures and adjusting gas fuel properties — a win-win for operations and decarbonization.
Metaverse solutions for field service workers and technicians don’t necessarily require additional hardware such as AR glasses or VR headsets. In fact, companies are exploring the use of AR with smartphones and tablets.
Shell applies extended reality in its industrial operations to bring off-site expertise closer. Using the company’s Augmented Reality Remote Assist, workers in the field can easily connect with remote experts worldwide for assistance. These experts can essentially see through field workers’ eyes to get a closer look at problems and coach the workers through solutions.
3. Optimizing production operations
By creating a detailed, virtual visualization of a shop floor’s manufacturing process to identify potential issues, dangers and bottlenecks, companies can apply the metaverse to improving operations performance and optimizing maintenance.
Pfizer, for instance, is creating a $450 million sterile injectables factory with a “virtual factory” component that will help optimize the value chain as well as provide more efficient training to employees. Through the virtual factory floor, Pfizer will be able to monitor its entire supply chain process and optimize it. And the digital twin technology will allow factory workers to do their job without ever stepping into the factory.
Meanwhile, Drone Deploy offers a 3D walkthrough system, which combines drone and ground images to create an accurate picture of a site, with accuracy down to one inch. While leaders look at businesses holistically, shop engineers can use these virtual replicas to monitor performance, spot issues and fix problems on the floor. And with the ability to call in help from off-site experts, they can do so much more efficiently.
4. Workforce training
According to Accenture research, 90% of senior executives believe that employee training methods need to be more effective, going as far as to engage all human senses. The metaverse can close this gap by advancing employee learning and development opportunities, providing increased value and competitive advantage.
From field workers to miners and mechanics, employees can jump into immersive virtual training experiences. At the same time, the organization lowers the risk of injury and damage to any equipment used in training, offering more profound experiences than didactic training materials and tools while reducing costs.
BASF Chemical, for instance, uses simulation software in which trainees can click on any piece of equipment in any workflow to get insight into how each piece fits into the process. This has made training faster, more interactive and self-directed. Since its implementation, BASF has reported a marked significant increase in worker competency and productivity.
When it comes to training, the metaverse is challenging the status quo, particularly with the most important part — retention. Research shows that employees forget 70% of traditional training content within 24 hours and nearly 90% in a month.
Extended reality uses technology to create a fully simulated environment where learners can interact with the experience hands-on. As trainees can experience an exact simulation of a situation in the virtual world, they can make mistakes without fear of harmful consequences, thus lowering the risk of failing fast and opening new windows to innovative, future-forward learning.
The first step towards harnessing the metaverse opportunity
Already, the metaverse is democratizing how engineers, designers and customers interact and change processes and operations for the better. To unlock the opportunity offered by the natural extension of digital twins into the metaverse, product and industrial companies must get their data backbones in order and build insights from the fusion of operational technology and IT data into their digital twins. This will allow them to simulate different scenarios for engineering design, operational environments and sustainability implications.

"Top skiers have signed a letter to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) demanding action over the climate emergency.
This season, there has been a notable lack of snow across Alpine resorts, leaving holidaymakers disappointed and causing some ski tournaments to be called off.
Global heating has meant that there is no longer guaranteed snow at some of the top ski areas, with the situation predicted to get worse as the planet heats and weather becomes more erratic.
Now, leading athletes have called for the FIS to overhaul its sustainability strategy, as it is lacking. They have asked for a more “geographically reasonable” race schedule to reduce carbon emissions, as often the races entail flying across the world multiple times. This year, the men’s circuit will have travelled from Europe to North America and back twice.
They are also asking for the ski season to be changed to keep up with climate breakdown. They have suggested shifting the start of the season from late October to late November and the end of the season from mid-March to late April.
“The seasons have shifted and in the interest of us all we need to adapt to those new circumstances,” they said.
The Norwegian racer Aleksander Aamodt Kilde told the Associated Press: “We see that the world is changing. We see also the impact of our sport … I want the future generations to experience winter and to be able to do what I do.”
The letter, signed by 200 athletes, was written by the Austrian downhiller Julian Schütter, ambassador for climate campaign group Protect Our Winters (Pow).
It says: “We are already experiencing the effects of climate change in our everyday lives and our profession. The public opinion about skiing is shifting towards unjustifiability … We need progressive organisational action. We are aware of the current sustainability efforts of FIS and rate them as insufficient.”
The American downhiller and Pow ambassador Travis Ganong added: “The simple truth of the matter is you can’t ski without snow and it’s going closer and closer every year to that.
“We really want to push our organising body to be leaders in this fight for climate change and currently I don’t think we are leading. I don’t know if it’s the schedule or what [the FIS] can change, but at least start looking deep into what we’re currently doing and how we can do it better.”
The FIS has been approached for comment."
"Even if you don’t like grocery shopping, you probably love Trader Joe’s. Once you’ve survived the parking lot, remembered your reusable bags and dug out your grocery list, you know you’re going to find at least a few items that make you smile.
That’s certainly true for professional nutritionists, who not only like food but tend to seek out the “good stuff” — for taste, nutrition and value — on shopping excursions. Many of them told us they’re devoted TJ’s fans.
“They make food fun, as it should be,” said registered dietitian Chelsey Amer. “The names of their products alone are fun, let alone the incredible flavor combinations they think of. There are so many great options and always something new to try. Plus, prices are affordable, and there are tons of nutritious options to help you feel energized.”
RD Marissa Meshulam said she works with some people “who feel overwhelmed by cooking for themselves.”
“What I love about Trader Joe’s is that they provide a place that feels so user-friendly for so many of us,” Meshulam said. “They’re filled with shortcut items that make cooking at home much quicker and easier.”
As you’re swanning happily down the aisles, you still need to pay attention to what you’re buying.
“People may think everything they sell is healthy, but you do have to look at the labels and ingredients,” said RD Sharon Palmer. “Although they’ve created standards about GMOs, synthetic colors and flavors, and sustainability, the store is not free of highly processed foods.”
Meshulam offered this eco-conscious reminder: “So many of their products come wrapped in plastic unnecessarily, which isn’t good for our health or the planet. Just be conscious of what you’re choosing and try to buy more of the stuff that is not plastic-wrapped.”
RD Chelsea Amer’s top picks
Chocolate Covered Banana Slices: “You’ll go bananas for this poppable dessert that also contains more antioxidants and fiber than other desserts. While you could make these yourself, the ease of having them premade is worth it.”
Israeli Feta Cheese: “I lived in Israel for a few years, and I can attest that this cheese tastes just like it does in there — creamy, salty, but is still able to hold up well in a Greek salad or that viral baked feta dish from TikTok. A little goes a long way, and adding this cheese to meals is a great way to boost satisfaction.”
Red Argentinian Shrimp: “Shrimp are incredibly versatile and great in tacos, salads and burgers. These are the best frozen shrimp you’ll find. I always have an extra bag in my freezer.”
RD Marissa Meshulam’s top picks
Wild Caught Tuna Packets: “I love these for a quick, no-cook lunch option that has 22 grams of protein. The tuna in these packets is skipjack, meaning it is lower in mercury than other varieties of tuna. I mix it with some avocado and Dijon mustard.”
Steamed Lentils: “Lentils are a super nutritious plant-based protein and fiber source. I love that they’re already cooked, so you can add them to your meal as is. I use them cold to top salads or heated as a part of a warm bowl with roasted veggies.”
Organic Herb Salad Mix: “I’m team ‘No Boring Salads,’ and this mix of organic greens and herbs is a big help. It provides great texture and flavor without having to buy a bunch of different things.”
RD Vanessa Rissetto’s top picks
Ancient Grain Lentil Soup: “It’s delicious, high fiber and decent on the sodium content.”
Frozen Rice: “Just put in the microwave for three minutes, right in the bag, and you have a starch with your dinner that you didn’t have to create from scratch, but which actually tastes good.”
Candied Pecans: “They’re low carb, high protein and awesome for salad toppings or a snack.”
RD Toby Smithson’s top picks
Almond Butter: “I put this in my shopping cart at every visit. I’ve found it to be less expensive compared to other grocers, and I love that there are only one to two ingredients: almonds and sea salt, or just almonds in the no-salt-added variety. It also contains less saturated fat than many other competitor brands.”
Jicama Wraps: “This is a great way to increase your vegetable intake and have a low carb wrap with some added cool crunchiness. Two wraps are only 15 calories, 2 grams of carbohydrate and 3 grams of fiber.”
Charlee Bear dog treats: “These are a favorite with our pups. They have just 3 calories per treat, only four ingredients, and do not cause any intestinal issues.”
RDN Jerlyn Jones’ top picks
Plantain Chips: “They’re a little sweet, salty and crunchy, plus they’re low in sodium and a good source of potassium, which is a nutrient most Americans don’t get enough of daily.”
Raw California Walnut Halves And Pieces: “They’re a powerhouse of important nutrients for good health. Walnuts are a rich source of magnesium, protein and fiber, and are high in omega-3 ALA, which may help lower heart disease risk. Add a handful to smoothies, salads, oatmeal and pancakes.”
RDN Bianca Tamburello’s top picks
Chomps: “High-protein snacks are hard to find, so I always pick up a handful of these for the week. The Original Beef Stick offers up a whopping 9 grams of protein for major filling power, with just 90 calories per serving. I liked to add diced Chomps to lunch salads for a protein and flavor boost.”
Vegan Buffalo Style Dip: “This spicy dip makes snacking on veggies so much more fun. I love that it’s made with cauliflower, red peppers and carrots, rather than the usual cream cheese or sour cream. This makes it lower in calories and saturated fat than most Buffalo dips, but it still has all the deliciousness. Use it as a spread for spicy sandwiches and wraps, too.”
Vegan Spinach and Cashew Ravioli: “I always have a package of these in my freezer, ready for simple and delicious meals. Sautee the cooked ravioli with canned artichokes, cherry tomatoes and pesto for a tasty dinner in just minutes.”"
"The threat of climate change has pushed companies to embrace a more sustainable future, with an increasing number of companies announcing their commitment to ESG and sustainability. But such commitments need to be supported by concrete action, and there are growing calls to leverage digital technologies towards a better and greener future, highlighting the potential of data for sustainable development.
Bringing digital technologies and sustainability together makes logical sense. The green transition and the digital transition have been two of the most significant global business trends over the past several years, and are twin challenges: neither can succeed without the other. In practice, digitalization is being increasingly understood by companies as a way to improve environmental performance with firms such as Mercedes Benz and Analog Devices announcing their commitment to sustainability using digital.
And now, a recent study provides empirical evidence to support the relationship between the two trends. A recent article by Prof. David Bendig and colleagues highlights a strong positive relationship between companies that strategically prioritize digital technologies and their environmental performance
Digital Orientation and Environmental Performance
According to Bendig and colleagues, companies that have a strong strategic focus on digital technologies tend to have a greater ability to adapt to changing market conditions, as well as to identify and exploit opportunities for innovation. Such companies also tend to be more efficient in their resource use, leading to lower costs and reduced environmental impact.
Take the software company Teradata Corporation, one of the firms selected for their sample. In their 2021 ESG report, Teradata committed to developing technology products and services for a sustainable future. It also committed to leveraging digital tools for video conferencing and virtual workplaces for its employees to achieve environmental goals such as resource efficiency. Likewise, computer software manufacturing company Seagate and offshore oil drilling company Schlumberger, are committed to using novel data-driven technologies and digital solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and resource waste in their operations. These initiatives point to a digital orientation on the part of these companies which was also associated with an improvement in their environmental performance across the period of study.
“We suggest that managers can improve their company’s environmental performance and competitive position by increasing the level of strategic digital orientation within their organizations” explains Bendig. Developing a strategic digital orientation consists of developing technologies, features, and functionalities that meet the needs of the customer; developing digital capabilities within the firm; coordinating a digital ecosystem, and having a digital architecture configuration.
In this regard, the study also carves out important implications for policymakers who want to drive sustainable growth. Bendig recommends, “If we want companies to embrace digitalization and reduce their environmental impact, we need to give them a powerful incentive, that’s why policymakers should consider offering subsidies or tax relief to companies that invest in proven green technologies.” With the right policies in place, a thriving ecosystem of environmentally conscious companies that are leading the way toward a sustainable future may be created.
Positive Knock-On Effects for Society
In addition to the direct benefits for businesses, this shift towards digital sustainability can also have positive knock-on effects for society as a whole. As companies become more sustainable and efficient, they may also develop new business models and products that encourage consumers to reduce their environmental impact, leading to a more sustainable future for all. Furthermore, prioritizing digital sustainability allows companies to catalyze positive change in their wider ecosystems, mitigating the environmental impact of their entire value chain and ultimately contributing to a sustainable future for all.
Digital technologies and data have the potential to be powerful tools in the fight against climate change and the move toward a more sustainable future. By prioritizing digital orientation and sustainability, companies can not only improve their own bottom line but also contribute to a brighter future for society at large."

"Digital transformation encompasses all spheres of life and verticals. While the digital world is increasingly connecting with the real one and new challenges arise. DigitialMara has prepared the observation of emerging tech trends. Among them are industry cloud platforms, autonomous systems, Metaverse, Web3, and multi-experience.
Businesses strive to add sustainability to operational processes and deliver sustainable products and services. According to Gartner, the digital solution can be named sustainable if it brings good environmental, social, and governance outcomes to all market participants. In this case, AI, cloud technologies, and automation will proceed to rock, accompanied by digital twins and 3D printing.
Businesses invest in AI-based products to empower internal and external processes, provide services and improve user experience. IDC estimates expenditures on AI technologies as $500 billion in 2023. Technology helps companies to optimize resilience, scale operations, and leverage data-driven decision-making.
Digital trust is a fundamental part of all financial processes going online. Thus, more businesses and individuals increasingly prefer online transactions. There is a demand for new security measures. A decentralized network developed with Blockchain technologies can be a viable solution. This architectural approach assumes encryption for data transmission and storage and a coordinated form of digital ownership.
Let’s look in more detail at the tech trends that impact production and consumption, development, and perception. Trends are split into three blocks: business solutions, user experience, web, and mobile development.
Business solutions tech trends
-
Autonomous systems
Automation is becoming progressively more popular in various industries and applications as enterprises are going for more rational approaches choosing resilience and efficiency. Autonomous systems can empower most of the processes: increase accuracy and productivity, provide flexibility and data-driven insights, and reduce the time for repetitive tasks.
Their scope of application is wide. They can be used in manufacturing, vehicles, supply chains, delivery, logistics, healthcare, energy solutions, etc.
Autonomous systems have a fairly complex architecture and consist of several components – digital tools. The obligatory requirements are reliability, safety, and real-time control. The main advantage of the systems is the ability to adapt to changing conditions and make decisions independently on large amounts of data.
The data is being collected from AI systems, automated quality management, IoT sensors, drones, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and quality control systems. To develop such a system, you will need a team of data scientists, systems engineers, and programmers.
-
Industry cloud platforms
Moving to the cloud allows companies to be more flexible, scalable, and accelerate processes. Industry cloud platforms or industry clouds are designed specifically to meet the needs of industries such as healthcare, retail, finance, government, and others.
They are a combination of software, platform, and Infrastructure-as-a-service. According to Gartner, more than 50% of core business operations will be conducted using cloud platforms by 2027. Experts believe that this approach goes beyond the traditional cloud and brings extra value to enterprises.
With cloud platforms, one can create an environment in compliance with all security and privacy standards, use predetermined industry scenarios and processes, and handle multilayer tasks. Their tool kit is composed of data models, workflows, and APIs, with the addition of advanced capabilities like AI and ML, IoT, blockchain, AR, and VR capabilities. Enterprise gets the system with greater performance that stands heavy loads and prosses high volumes of data.
-
Platform engineering
Platform engineering aims to increase developers’ productivity, clarify processes, and enhance the experience. And what’s more important is to speed up the delivery of software. Such platforms combine standard toolkits, self-service capabilities, reusable and configurable components and services, and automated processes. The team gets the infrastructure that is centrally managed and enhanced workflows. And the benefit for companies lies in the consistency and efficiency of processes.
In general, the building of the platform covers the following key areas: an internal platform for developers, security of key delivery processes, internal service level agreements, and team performance indicators. However, the platform is not universal and must be adapted to the needs of each organization. The specific functions depend entirely on the requirements of users – developers, data processing specialists, and others.
User experience trends
-
Metaverse
Metaverse is strongly accessioned by Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, but this notion is much broader. This is a new type of digital interaction with an immersive effect replicating the real world. So that users have a sort of real-life experience in the virtual world. According to Mckinsey’s presentation, there are five basic activities that can be conducted in Metaverse.
They are entertainment, social, gaming, travel, and shopping. It seems to me education can also benefit from this technology. Meetings, conferences, and other events can be held in the Metaverse. Brands can sell their products and launch marketing campaigns. It is possible to carry out training and build digital-twin models.
Metaverse development is a rather laborious process that requires a wide range of technologies and technical requirements. Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Virtual and Augmented reality, 3D modeling, distributed computing, microservices, and edge computing are basic technologies here.
The infrastructure must be stable, and all data must be strictly secured. The system must endure a heavy load and work equally well on different platforms and devices, as thousands of people interact simultaneously and take action from different gadgets.
However, things are going not so bright. Companies invest in the metaverse but don’t always get a return. For example, Meta company, having already invested $100 billion in two years, has lost $3.7 billion in the last few months. Many things have led to this.
Starting from bad-looking avatars and an incomplete environment and ending with a lack of own video games for virtual reality and poor sales of headsets. And don’t forget about reputational losses – low level of trust.
-
AI chatbots
Chatbots can be used much more widely than customer support and sales. AI makes them smart, capable of adapting to the conversation and providing customers with human-like interactions. Depending on the level of complexity of the algorithm embedded in them, they can be used in social apps for fun conversation, therapy apps for primary diagnostics and recommendations, and educational apps to answer general questions and conduct tests.
Chatbots also can assist with the internal processes of the company and become a part of employee services: IT help, employee training, administrative help, HR bots, etc. They can perfectly complement messengers, websites, and applications.
Smart bots are based on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning models, which are capable of remembering previous conversations and constantly learning and, as an output, show more personalized communication.
You may not be limited to this basic functionality. And add, for example, behavioral analytics to adjust embedded conversation flows or automated translation to make chat multilingual. At the same time, one should keep in mind that customers often share both personal and sensitive information. Therefore, data protection is crucial.
-
Multiexperience
The rising adaptation of voice, wearables, AI, and AR has led to a multi-experience approach, which means creating the same smooth, connective, and engaging experience across multiple digital touchpoints. The user consistently interacts with your software product across websites, mobile apps, voice assistants, chatbots, and various types of wearable devices and manages it with voice, text, and touch.
Multi-experience Development Platforms (MXDP) come to allow you to facilitate the development process and deploy your app on various devices. Gartner defines MXDP as a combination of front-end development tools and “backend for frontend” capabilities to build fit-for-purpose apps that are based on touchpoint-specific modalities. They support iOS and Android development, cross-platform development, responsive and progressive web apps, chatbots, IoT, and AR apps.
-
Voice search
Voice search optimization of our websites and apps should be a part of your strategy, as most modern devices have voice recognition function. Statista claims by 2024, the total number of digital voice assistants will attain 8.3 million. Customers use voice commands not only for smartphones but also for a wide range of smart home devices and smart systems in vehicles. It frees up hands, saves time, and enables multitasking. In general, this is an efficient way to interact with your customers, thanks to a quick reaction to their requests.
Software development trends
-
Web3
Web3 is a relatively new technology. Some see its potential in it, while others have concerns. Ultimately, we can expect this to change the architecture and basic principles of web platforms and how users interact amongst themselves and with the platforms. The innovation of the Web3 approach is that it offers a rejection of centralized systems and intermediaries.
While all interactions are going peer-to-peer. Critics argue that such a system is acceptable for public solutions but not for enterprises. Some examples here are NFTs and play-to-earn games, and decentralized finance.
The technology stack of Web3 development combines the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), Blockchain capabilities, and AI adaptive algorithms. Semantic web, cryptocurrency payments, verifiable authenticity, and automation are some key features. At the same time, the emphasis should be placed on ensuring proper cyber hygiene, protection of personal data, and privacy.
-
Low-code (no-code)
Low-code development is gaining more and more popularity. And there are a large number of low-code platforms on the market as an alternative to conventional development. Their principle of operation is based on a “drag-and-drop” interface and pre-configured templates.
One can use web and mobile development, IoT development, testing, workflow automation, AI chatbots, data science, and more. With this approach, you can quickly develop and deploy with minimal resources. It’s a viable option for MVP development if you are a startup.
When working with low-code or no-code, you need to consider several nuances. Choosing a platform, you should keep in mind a wide range of factors. For example, cloud support, integration with existing systems, number of users, collaborative IDEs, multichannel deployment, ability to scale, and more.
Platforms lack customization opportunities and may have technical limitations for modification of your code. In professional hands, low-code is a good instrument, able to save your time and resources and validate your idea.
-
Automation testing
You should consider automation testing as a part of your QA policy, as your software quality is crucial both for internal processes and for the products and services that you are providing to customers. Obviously, various types of malfunctions, failures, freezes, late detection of bugs, and operational errors lead to reputational and financial losses.
Automation provides greater testing coverage and allows handling continuous testing covering all stages of the development process. Automated tests are more accurate, efficient, and reliable and also save time and costs.
The faster you can test and debug, may faster to launch your product. While higher the quality of your software – the higher the customer satisfaction. Creating automated tests is the task of a QA engineer.
And advanced technologies like cloud, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and robotic process automation can help with it and extend the capabilities of the tests. For example, creating multiple testing environments and specific scenarios, emulating real-world conditions, conducting large-scale testing, and more.
Final words
The digital world is continuously evolving as new challenges arise that can be solved with the help of technology. In turn, emerging technologies are also shaping trends. Businesses need to be flexible and adapt to these processes. Investigating and understanding trends enables staying competitive in a rapidly changing market. You can adjust your strategy, explore new growth opportunities and identify areas for investment.

"Leicester Tigers have admitted they are “suffering some very challenging conditions” and are intent on raising £13m of fresh investment in the Premiership champions from two directors.
The Welford Road club’s proposal would mean Tom Scott, a nonexecutive director, and the executive chairman, Peter Tom, increasing their stakes and shareholders will vote on whether to accept the board’s plans next month.
“Tom Scott is a long-standing supporter of the club and a valued member of the board of directors who over his tenure with the club has already invested over £10m.” the chief executive, Andrea Pinchen, said in a statement.
“Peter Tom has been chairman of Leicester Tigers since 1993, having made 130 appearances for the club between 1963 and 1968 and has been a huge part in navigating the club through the professional era.
“We are very grateful that Peter and Tom are looking to extend their investments in Leicester Tigers at a time when the club is suffering some very challenging conditions from factors mostly outside of our control.
“Their decision to invest at this time will give the club the financial assurance to execute the club’s strategy of continued success and financial sustainability.”
Leicester’s bid to raise funds comes as the professional game faces an increasingly hostile financial setting, with two clubs – Worcester and Wasps – going bust. Wasps will play in the Championship next season but there has been no late reprieve for Worcester following their proposed rebranding as Sixways Rugby."

"Back at CES, Lenovo showed off a huge portfolio of new devices including a true dual-screen laptop and a desk lamp that doubles as a webcam. But now, Lenovo is back at Mobile World Congress with a few more refreshed notebooks and tablets headlined by two interesting updates to the ThinkPad Z family.
Designed to be ideal companions for hybrid workers, the new ThinkPad Z13 Gen 2 and Z16 Gen 2 feature an all-AMD setup. You’ll be able to choose from a range of Ryzen 7000 processors and even an optional Radeon 6650M graphics card on the larger Z16, along with up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage. However, for people who are constantly hopping on and off video calls, the ThinkPad Z13 and Z16’s new communication features might be the bigger draw.
That’s because in addition to new full HD webcams, you’ll also get support for Wi-Fi 6E and Dolby Voice-enabled microphones, so you should look and sound good on Zoom meetings. But my favorite new feature is the TrackPoint Quick Menu that can be summoned by simply double-tapping the company’s signature red nub. This opens a window that lets you quickly adjust things like camera settings, mic volume, voice dictation, noise suppression and more. You can even customize which settings you want to see so you have fast access to the things you tend to change most often and I think it’s a great way of adding new functionality to a classic component like the TrackPoint.
Other specs include up to a 13.3-inch 2.8K OLED display on the Z13 Gen 2 or a larger and higher resolution 16-inch 4K OLED panel on the Z16 Gen 2. Lenovo has also retained handy features like an electronic shutter for the webcam, in addition to dual speakers with Dolby Atmos, two or three USB ports depending on the system, and a dedicated SD card reader on the Z16.
Meanwhile, to help improve your mousing experience, both the Z13 and Z16 Gen 2 feature a Fusion UX touchpad from Sensel, which adds more sophisticated haptics, better palm rejection and more. On top of being physically larger (120mm across), long-time Trackpoint fans will also appreciate that Sensel’s touchpad supports three virtual haptic buttons that run across the top of the touchpad, so you’ll still have easy access to left and right mouse clicks without having to reach too far.
Finally, the last big change for the Z13 is that alongside the default aluminum finish, as part of its commitment to sustainability, Lenovo is also introducing a new flax fiber lid which is made from waste material collected during the harvesting process. This material is something we’ve seen before on a handful of concept cars from companies like Porsche and Polestar, but Lenovo says this is the first time this reinforced flax fiber material will be available on a consumer electronic device.
Admittedly, this isn’t for everyone, but I kind of like it because it looks almost like a futuristic take on wood paneling. Not only does this add a bit of warmth to the laptop’s appearance, just like a nice piece of furniture, each flax fiber lid features a unique grain, which gives the whole system a bit of added personality. On top of that, Lenovo says the lid is bonded to a top cover made from 75 percent recycled aluminum.
While their designs aren’t changing a ton (aside from that new lid option on Z13), the addition of speedier components, larger touchpads and better conferencing features should make the second-gen ThinkPad Z-series laptops even better at getting work done – both at home or in the office. And thanks to its optional flax fiber lid, the Z13 Gen 2 might be the most stylish and sustainable ThinkPad yet.
The ThinkPad Z13 Gen 2 is expected to go on sale sometime in July starting at $1,249, with the ThinkPad Z16 Gen arriving a bit later in August starting at $1,749."
"In 2014, three college students embarked on a mission to unravel the secrets of financial markets using the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The trio, Sylvain Forté, Pierre Rinaldi and Florian Aubry, founded SESAMm with the aim of harnessing the formidable might of social media to generate sentiment indicators.
Today, France-based SESAMm utilizes natural language processing (NLP) technology to extract insights from its proprietary data lake, which contains over 20 billion articles from free and premium sources. The firm just announced the closing of a series B2 funding round of €35 million ($37 million). The series B2 round was co-led by deep tech VC firm Elaia and Opera Tech Ventures, the venture capital arm of BNP Paribas.
Sentiment analysis, ESG insights from over 5 million companies
The SESAMm technology has found use by data and business teams including ESG (environmental, social and governance) specialists, procurement teams and deal teams. The company provides a range of use cases, including ESG controversy detection; detection of positive-impact events; competitive intelligence; and quantitative investment, with NLP signals generated on equities and macroeconomic factors.
Forté, CEO and cofounder of SESAMm, said: “Raising a significant amount during challenging market conditions highlights the relevance of SESAMm’s focus on two key trends: AI and sustainability. In turn, these tools enable organizations to make better decisions and fill the data gaps, particularly in ESG, in both public and private companies.”
Traditional ESG scores have come under scrutiny because of their lag in updates, issues with methodology and lack of transparency. SESAMm aims to solve these problems by providing up-to-date and unbiased information on companies. Its extensive coverage of more than five million private and public companies includes small and mid-cap firms in Europe and emerging markets, and private companies worldwide.
The company’s off-the-shelf ESG and reputational risk metrics provide investors and corporations with data where there are data gaps. Furthermore, SESAMm helps companies detect and protect against new risks in an increasingly complex macro environment through AI-powered real-time monitoring of inflation mentions across all geographies on the web.
NLP for private equity, finance and more
SESAMm counts as customers seven of the top 10 private equity firms worldwide, as well as other corporations of various sizes. The company’s plans focus on developing new products, with an emphasis on sustainability frameworks, taxonomies, and standardized reputational scores.
“SESAMm wants to become the premier NLP platform for financial firms and corporations looking to enhance their decision-making process by leveraging insights from the web. Our ultimate goal is to be an enabler for companies looking to maximize returns and mitigate risks,” Forté told VentureBeat. “We aim to make web data a real source of business insights using advanced technology. With such a keen focus on sustainability, we can only fulfill our goal of helping firms of all types to achieve their goals if SESAMm itself is truly a sustainable, profitable and responsible company.”
Other participating companies in SESAMm funding include asset manager Unigestion, Raiffeisen Bank International’s (RBI) venture capital entity Elevator Ventures, AFG Partners, CEGEE Capital, and historical backers including Carlyle (CG) and New Alpha Asset Management. Each participated in the previous series B1 round.
This latest round brings the total funding raised to €50 million ($53 million). This funding will enable SESAMm to further expand into U.S. and Asian markets; support development of AI-powered ESG and sentiment analytics; and hire key talent across sustainability, technology, sales and marketing.

"- James Comer attributed Silicon Valley Bank's failure to its ""woke"" ESG investments.
- ""This could be a trend and there are consequences for bad Democrat policy,"" Comer said on Sunday.
- Bernie Sanders said a 2018 law signed by former President Donald Trump is ""directly"" responsible for the collapse of SVB.
GOP Rep. James Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, slammed Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, as ""one of the most woke banks"" in the US.
""We see now coming out they were one of the most woke banks in their quest for the ESG-type policy and investing,"" Comer said, referring to environmental, social, and governance policies.
""This could be a trend and there are consequences for bad Democrat policy,"" the Kentucky congressman continued on Sunday's episode of Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
—Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 12, 2023
Comer did not explain which environmental sustainability-linked investments would have caused SVB's failure, or how they would have done so.
The word ""woke"" points to an awareness of how some systems can be unjust, but it has also been used by right-wing figures as a catch-all term for progressive policies.
SVB did invest in cleantech and environmental sustainability.
""We serve those creating positive environmental change,"" the bank said on its website. ""From alternative energy solutions to agricultural breakthroughs, we support individuals and businesses driving toward a healthier planet.""
SVB is far from the only financial institution to have put money into sustainable investing. ESG investments and green stocks saw a boom back in 2021. As of 2021, $18.4 trillion had been invested in ESG-related assets, per an October 2022 report by PwC. But conservative lawmakers have railed against ESG investments, calling it ""woke capitalism.""
And while Comer cited ""bad Democrat policy"" in SVB's failure, some Democratic figures have blamed Trump-era policies for the bank run. On Sunday, Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders said a 2018 law signed by former President Donald Trump is ""directly"" responsible for the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The law rolled back restrictions around smaller banks like SVB, and did not subject them to the same scrutiny that large financial institutions have to comply with.
Silicon Valley Bank's clients started running for the exits after the bank's management sold $21 billion worth of bonds at a $1.8 billion loss. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, shut down the bank on Friday. It has become the biggest bank failure in the US since the 2008 financial crisis.
In a statement on Sunday, the US Treasury, Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC announced all depositors would be fully protected and would have access to all their money starting Monday.
Representatives for Comer and Silicon Valley Bank did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment sent outside regular business hours."
"Title
Flathub: Linux App Store
Short description
Promote diversity and sustainability in the Linux desktop community by adding payments, donations and subscriptions to the Flathub app store.
Author(s)
@ramcq @neilmcgovern @aleixpol
Proposal body
The GNOME Foundation and KDE e.V. have been jointly building and growing Flathub as a vendor-neutral service for Linux application developers to build and publish their applications directly to their end users. A healthy application ecosystem is essential for the success of the OSS desktop, so end-users can trust and control their data and development platforms on the device in front of them.
In order to incentivise participation in the Linux application ecosystem, and remove financial barriers that prevent diverse participation, GNOME has sponsored work over the past year to add donations and payments to Flathub via Stripe, as well as a process to verify developer identities and allow direct uploads to ease the publishing process. This year we are planning to launch this work together with appropriate legal and governance setup, and are seeking additional funding to add: subscriptions / recurring donations, review tools to prevent abusive application submissions and automated security/vulnerability scanning. Over time we hope that Flathub can become self-sustaining through transaction fees and corporate sponsorship.
The GNOME Foundation is a non-profit organization that believes in a world where everyone is empowered by technology they can trust. We do this by building a diverse and sustainable free software personal computing ecosystem. We have been operating as a project since August 1997, and as a Foundation since August 2000. Together with KDE e.V., we maintain that end-user trust, transparency and control of the devices in front of them, such as desktops, laptops and workstations, is an essential pre-requisite so that we posess neutral platforms from which user-respecting internet and cloud experiences can continue to be developed.
Due diligence
- What's your theory of change -- what impact do you expect this project to have? What's its goal?
A key barrier to the growth and adoption of open source software on the desktop is the requirement for certain applications to be available so that they are able to be fully productive using the open source desktop. The current nature of open source operating systems, especially for end users where applications are distributed at zero cost alongside the OS itself precludes establishing any incentives for application developers and prevents the distribution of paid-for applications. Intentionally or not, many stakeholders such as traditional Linux OS vendors act as gatekeepers, slowing the ability of potential application developers to publish to their users, as well as disincentivizing any application developer who is unable to learn, produce and support their application without any remuneration.
Through our organisations' participation in schemes such as Google Summer of Code and Outreachy, we have observed the impact of this effect on individuals from diverse and underpriveleged backgrounds - by electing to participate in our internship schemes, they missed opportunities for internships with other local technology employers, and struggle to find employment compared to their peers who work outside the free and open source space. By opening new pathways for individuals and small businesses to monetise their participation in the OSS desktop space, we hope to create a more level playing field for innovation and creation of sustainable economic models, as can be found on competing proprietary platforms.
We feel it is key for a broad range of applications to be available that software developers are able to receive funds for their applications, and we are building a vendor-neutral commercial and technical ecosystem to publish and distribute end-user applications for personal computing devices running Linux. Our goals are to increase the availability of applications available for Linux desktop users, and remove financial barriers for entry for diverse participants to join the developer community.
- What related work has already been done in this area?
Building on top of the existing Flathub build and distribution service, which has been enjoying consistent year on year growth since 2017, over the past year the GNOME Foundation has been preparing the technical pre-requisites for Flathub to collect optional donations or mandatory payments from users on behalf of app developers. We have introduced a verification process to ensure that the uploader of the application is a bona fide representative of the developer, set up API integration with Stripe Connect to handle marketplace payments, added the necessary authentication steps for users to create accounts on the store, complete the checkout process, and issue tokens to users and developers to download and upload applications. This work is currently drawing to a close and we are ready to launch a beta service for testing/consultation with application developers.
Outside of the Linux desktop space, actors such as F-Droid provide a home for free and open source Android applications on mobile devices. However on Linux desktops and workstations, the Linux distributions have historically held near-exclusive control on the selection and delivery of applications to the users, stifling the pace of innovation (apps develop at a very different pace to the OS itself) and removing any financial incentives for developer participation.
There have been various niche efforts to bring app stores to specific Linux distributions - Lindows/Linspire pioneering the ""Click'n'Run"" app store some 20 years ago, and more recently Elementary OS has been experimenting with their ""pay what you can"" app store. These efforts, specific to one Linux OS or another, are by definition pursuing a niche of a niche as they have not been able to aggregate supply and demand between application developers or users.
Our largest ""competitor"" in the Linux app store space is Canonical's Snap Store, which (aside from any debates as to the relative technical merits of Flatpaks versus Snaps) sits under the control of one corporate entity rather than a community-controlled nonprofit, requiring copyright assignments for contributions to both Snap and the Store, and effectively making it very hard or unappealing to run your own stores. It consequentially enjoys far less support across community Linux-based platforms and is included by default in very few distributions apart from Canonical's own Ubuntu. Commercially vendor-neutral and under the governance of long-standing trusted nonprofits in the space, Flathub is uniquely positioned to start offering these app store services in support of the OSS application ecosystem and development community.
- How is this proposal innovative -- what distinguishes it from other related work?
The Flathub platform is undergoing a number of transitions as a result of growing from a build and delivery service to an app store that allows binary uploads, and introduces fiscal incentives which may encourage abusive or misleading uploads. We are not aware of many pre-existing solutions in the open source space to this problem set, and those which do exist are not immediately applicable to the tooling around managing and publishing repositories of Flatpak applications.
We have added programmatic verification (via DNS, GitLab or GitHub credentials, etc) of application authorship based on their programmatic ""app ID"" identifiers, but this does not account for misleading application names, descriptions, screenshots, etc, so we need to develop tooling that detects changes in these areas and blocks submissions until these changes have been reviewed. Similarly, changes in (purported) license have an effect on how Flathub will promote and price applications, so these claims and any changes need to be checked.
As we also open the ability for applications to be uploaded in binary form, which is essential for low-friction compatibility with popular language-specific build systems such as Electron/Node, Rust, Go, etc - we also reduce the ability for users to scrutinise the source in the Flathub build system that was used to build their application. The importance of automated scanning for malware and outdated/vulnerable components therefore increases - there are tools in the cloud space which can do such automated scanning of OCI containers, and we intend to adapt these tools to apply to the desktop application space. (We can draw on pre-existing work to represent Flatpak applications as OCI container images and vice versa.)
- Who is your doer -- who will execute the proposed work?
Robert McQueen was one half of the team that launched the original Flathub service in 2017, and continues to serve as part of the Flathub governance process overseeing the ongoing development work, as well as President of the GNOME Foundation board of directors. The GNOME Foundation has acted as fiscal sponsor for Flathub since this time, hiring a full-time devops engineer to operate the service, as well as providing legal support, operational costs, handling donations, managing and sponsoring development work.
In the past year, the GNOME Foundation has outsourced $50k of work to a combination of corporate and individual contractors active in the Flatpak community, which has worked extremely well to bring the combined expertise of Codethink and James Westman to developing our app verification, direct uploads, and adding Stripe integration with payments, donations, tax invoicing, card payments, receipts, etc.
We plan to continue the next phase of work in a similar manner, working with community contractors for the development work, and recruiting an additional staff member to the GNOME Foundation team to help establish the operations, review and security processes around the new paid service.
- How might this work be sustained long-term after an initial seed grant?
Flathub is already governed by a desktop-neutral committee involving key representatives from GNOME Foundation and KDE e.V., and currently enjoys 1500 collaborators maintaining some 1800 apps on the existing service. In parallel with the technical development of the platform and launch of the app store functionality, the GNOME Foundation and KDE e.V. will be establishing a new legal entity, Flathub LLC to own and operate the service. We will establish a transparent governance process to help maintain community trust and accountability, and build an advisory board / sponsorship process to attract commercial sponsorship to the service in parallel to our grant applications.
The paid application service will be operated at a subsidized fee for free and open source software applications in support of the GNOME Foundation and KDE e.V’s shared missions, and running costs will be supported by the fees collected, and a combination of corporate sponsorship and grant funding.
Resources needed
Our total budget for the coming year is 200k USD, including 120k USD towards salaries for a devops engineer and review/operations staff, USD 30k towards legal, professional and administration costs, and USD 50k towards the development of the software platform itself.
Our previous phase of implementing the Flathub appstore functionality was funded by a 50,000 USD grant from Dalio Philanthropies, and we are in the process confirming a subsequent 100,000 USD grant which will cover 50% of our planned budget for the coming year.
We are seeking up to 100,000 USD support from the Plaintext Group to cover the remaining budget to establish the new Flathub organisation and paid service over the coming year.

"As companies face increasing public and internal calls for action on environmental and societal crises, more corporate leaders are launching or expanding practices to enhance their impact and chart a path for long-term business success. But their words and actions sometimes don’t align with their political contributions and lobbying efforts, an issue that came under the spotlight in the wake of the divisive 2020 election and Jan. 6 Capitol attacks.
One backdrop for this corporate discord is the current era of ever-growing corporate political spending, which continues to set records in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling, and a pay-to-play system where high-dollar donors influence policy decisions that may benefit their bottom line but harm the planet or society at large. Amid the ever-widening gap between the ultrawealthy and frontline workers who lag in income levels and well-being, more people are looking to work for and do business with companies that share their values — and some corporate leaders are looking for new ways to align their political influence approaches and actions with their company’s values and commitment to stakeholders, including the environment, workers, and customers. Another key element of the context are new questions and concerns about whether business has a legitimate basis for engaging on any given issue — through spending, public statements, lobbying and so on.
To provide a framework for those companies ready to align their words and actions with planetary and societal sustainability and uphold their stakeholder commitments, the Corporate Political Responsibility Taskforce at the University of Michigan’s Erb Institute is announcing the Erb Principles for Corporate Political Responsibility. To learn more about the principles and the taskforce’s future plans to build on them with corporate leaders and others in the business community, I recently spoke with Taskforce Director Elizabeth Doty as part of my research on purpose-driven business. Following that interview, I also gathered written input from Erb Institute Faculty Director, Tom Lyon.
Christopher Marquis: How did this set of principles came about? How are you launching them publicly?
Elizabeth Doty: The Erb Principles for CPR are the first output of the Institute’s Corporate Political Responsibility Taskforce or “CPRT.” We convened the taskforce amidst the crises in early 2021 with two goals: to help companies better align their approach to political influence with their purpose, values and commitments and to help establish CPR as a shared norm. So, for the past 14 months, a group of executives in government affairs, sustainability, DEI, communications, and board governance roles have been working to distill this common set of principles for corporate political responsibility, with help from a broad network of stakeholders and experts.
On March 7, we are announcing these Principles with five inaugural supporters, including IBM, Pirelli Tire North America, Danone North America, Aspen Skiing and DSM North America. Each of these companies has committed to take a measurable action over the next 12 months, which is one of the ways this effort is different. Then, over the following year we will add new supporters and work with CPRT members to map out additional actions and put the Erb Principles into practice.
Tom Lyon: The basic idea of corporate political responsibility is that companies not only need to align their words and actions with their commitments, but that they also have a shared interest and a responsibility to support the larger systems on which we all depend. In practice, CPR may mean different policy positions and priorities than a company has adopted in the past, or it may mean refraining from getting involved in the first place.
Marquis: If a CEO had never really heard of this work and you wanted to convey why this is important to them what would you say? Basically, what’s your elevator pitch?
Doty: The key proposition is that companies need a non-partisan, principled thought process to weigh whether and how to engage in civic and political affairs. With trust in civic institutions continuing to decline, expectations for business keep rising, and acting on these expectations is easier said than done. In the face of new pressures and new questions from employees, investors, customers and now lawmakers, leaders are asking themselves: Should we engage on this issue? If we do get involved, how do we do so responsibly?
Clearly, companies will not and should not weigh in on every issue. They need to be responsible with the use of their incredible power and influence. So, we outline a thought process based on four questions:
● Legitimacy: On what basis do we authentically engage in civic or political affairs?
● Accountability: Are our political activities aligned with our values, purpose, and commitments to all stakeholders?
● Responsibility: Do our political activities support the systems on which markets, society and life depend?
● Transparency: Do we communicate openly about our political activities to relevant stakeholders and to promote public trust?
As you can see, the process does not prescribe specific policy positions but helps companies be responsible in ways that are specific to them. That said, the Principles are not agnostic about American constitutional democracy, competitive markets, informed civil discourse, or avoiding harm. These are areas that companies feel they can stand on and appeal to the concerns of many, many American citizens.
Lyon: The focus on foundational systems is incredibly important. We debate how to solve problems and create opportunities for people, planet and profit, but we often lose sight of the role of market rules, civic institutions, and civil discourse in shaping whether that actually happens. For example, with the wrong market rules, you can have monopolies or externalities like pollution, which mean earning a profit isn’t actually creating value for society. This is a tenet from classical economics, but it also seems to be an area of common ground for many Americans.
The biggest distinguishing factors for the principles? The first is that they are pragmatic and workable. Second, they take a “third side” view. This is where the CPRT process worked well. We wrestled with different views, and gradually found a thought process based on common ground, knowing we will still debate specific issues. Third, they always include action. And finally, they approach CPR as a journey. This is difficult territory involving judgment and learning over time. It’s taken a long time to get here, and it will take a long time to get back to that trust and to systemic solutions. The Principles can provide the focal point for more constructive dialogue.
Marquis: What companies are supporting the principles with the taskforce? Any examples of how they’re making changes to align with them?
Doty: First, we should distinguish between formally declaring support for the Erb Principles and taking actions to improve CPR. Many companies have been taking action on their own or with coalitions, or applying political responsibility to specific issues. Still others are making changes internally without yet going public. That said, we think the time is right for more companies to be explicit about their commitments to political responsibility, and the Principles provide a way to do that.
So, thus far, five companies have publicly stepped forward as supporters of the Erb Principles for CPR. We are immensely proud to announce IBM, Pirelli Tire North America, Danone North America, Aspen Skiing and DSM North America as inaugural supporters, who have taken a critical step in helping to establish CPR as a shared norm. As I mentioned, each supporter commits to adopt one of three concrete actions over the next 12 months.
Pirelli Tire North America and Aspen Skiing are working with the Center for Political Accountability to be ready to adopt the new CPA-Zicklin Model Code of Conduct for Political Spending. This will require disclosing and overseeing any election-related spending, reviewing candidate positions and spending through trade associations, and ensuring full transparency on the use of trade association dues.
IBM is now using the Legitimacy principle to weigh whether to get involved in specific issues, and finding it useful in framing conversations with stakeholders and articulating their reasoning with respect for stakeholder concerns. In addition, IBM is one of 22 S&P 500 companies that have prohibited political spending, according to the Center for Political Accountability. They argue that focusing on “policy, not politics” pushes them to advocate based on the quality of their ideas, reduces reputational risks and pressure to contribute, and avoids emerging concerns about the use of shareholder funds for political purposes. Interestingly, the number of S&P 500 companies prohibiting spending has increased from 10 to 20 since 2018.
Finally, based on its adoption of the Erb Principles, DSM North America has committed to review the policy positions of its trade associations to ensure alignment with its mission, purpose and values, and to exit if the trade groups are not willing to change their positions.
Marquis: How can individuals help push this forward? Can they demand that companies they work for or buy from are politically responsible?
Lyon: Companies are listening to their employees and more employees are speaking up. One of the most effective strategies is just asking the question, on what basis is my organization engaging? Is this a legitimate use of our voice and authority? How are we weighing tradeoffs? How are we deciding whether to support the Inflation Reduction Act? How are we weighing a candidate’s record on respect for rule of law versus their committee positions that might benefit our industry? Those sorts of questions are surfacing important conversations at the senior levels, and employee resource groups are one forum for thinking them through. That said, companies need to be sure they are listening to employees who are not as vocal and recognize that there are limits to what employees are willing to discuss in the workplace.
Also, investors should be careful in voting proxies and look at those related to disclosure of political spending or guidance on political influence. Interestingly, decisions such as Citizens United assumed that shareholders would have that information.
Marquis: In my work with students, I’ve noticed that younger people tend to be more demanding of companies, speaking out when they see them tilt the playing field in ways that advantage them and pass costs on to society. They also want companies CEOs to fight for social justice and environmental issues. How does the framework align with younger people’s engagement and increasing expectation of companies?
Doty: Younger employees are a really incredible channel for more systems thinking inside companies, because they’re bringing in their viewpoints as citizens and those who will inherit the longer term. Also, culturally, they don’t see as much separation between their work identities and their personal lives. In a talent-constrained world, this is getting attention from company decision-makers. We can view these perspectives as a way to keep ourselves honest, to challenge our assumptions, and perhaps as a valuable source of a more systemic view.
That said, many younger folks I talk with push companies to get involved on societal issues, because they view them as the most powerful voice. We debate this all the time. There is a risk of a dangerous precedent, of using corporate power for any preferred cause. Companies have a structural advantage in resources and ability compared to consumer and citizen advocacy efforts. Do you want that used for any cause that becomes popular, even if it’s one you disagree with? Those are some of the concerns we are hearing now about companies getting involved beyond their purview.
Lyon: On the other hand, it may be necessary in our current situation to push companies to be more proactive on issues like climate change. That’s one reason we apply more nuanced principles. We do think that companies have three bases for engaging, and one of them is Consequence; issues like political stability, democracy, and a stable climate that are of such consequence that it is a basic matter of citizenship to weigh in. Then there are commitments you’ve made. Your purpose and values, or even your business strategy, which were the reason why people decided to work for you or invest in or buy from you. So at IBM, inclusion, social justice and racial equity have been commitments since the ’60s. And that is a basis for getting involved in some issues now. And finally, the last reason is Contribution, or the areas where your company has the most impact. So, Patagonia is another example, with its apparel and organic cotton farming, and its decision to apply its political influence there most importantly, because that’s where they have the most outbound impact.
Marquis: Looking globally, are there examples or lessons that U.S. businesses could pull from companies in other countries?
Doty: In the rest of the world there is a norm of not enabling or not allowing political spending from corporate treasuries. That it is just such a conflict of interest, for an economic entity to influence economic rules. I’ve had senior executives from global companies laugh when I discuss CPR because corporate political influence is not even legal in most places. On the other hand, there’s a lot more disclosure in the U.S., especially around PAC spending and things like that, that is not the norm in other countries.
The World Benchmarking Alliance just came out with its updated social indicators. It basically sets non-spending as a benchmark for around the world, and then alignment of spending is the second criteria. I think it’s a start.
Marquis: During many of my presentations, I include the Business Roundtable and how this group of large companies are signaling that stakeholders are important. But recently a series of studies have shown that Business Roundtable companies actually do worse on environmental outcomes. They have worse environmental infractions. They have worse labor outcomes. During a recent presentation, someone raised their hand and asked, “Do you know that they lobbied for Trump’s tax cuts and against the Inflation Reduction Act?” And I said, “Yes, that’s actually what my next slide shows.” It is so disappointing how companies and groups like this talk in one way yet lobby in another. How do you think about this?
Doty: One of the most powerful ways to think about the times we’re in is that the Business Roundtable is attempting to craft or articulate an emerging new social contract. That these are our obligations in a general way. Each of our companies are different, but in general we have acknowledged these obligations as part of a social contract. Now others are challenging that contract, pushing back on balancing shareholders and stakeholders. But neither one addresses the question of responsible corporate political influence. This critical, because it affects democracy and representation, as well as the market rules that drive economic outcomes.
So what we’re exploring is, what would be the elements of responsible engagement? Where does business legitimately engage in influencing policy? And where is it illegitimate? So, for example, lobbying for tax cuts at the expense of policies around climate, plastic waste or economic opportunity. Implementing barriers to trade, and protecting subsidies that enable pollution. These may benefit your business, and there is room for debate, but there are definitely ways to use your influence to tilt the playing field against the premise of free markets. One of our foundational premises is that you will help enable markets to serve their purpose, which was the whole point of the invisible hand idea — to serve and create value for society — so that you’re hurting stakeholders from the get-go if you’re not doing that.
In practice, this is not so easy, in our current environment. An article by Lee Drutman describes two trends over the last 40 years: of the ever-escalating influence of business in state capitals and in Washington over who gets elected, what positions they get in government, and then policies. So there is this increasing influence, but also a narrowing of the basis for influence, which that Mark Mizruchi wrote about in The Fracturing of the American Corporate Elite. It’s become normalized for influence to more legitimate to have it be based on tax benefits or subsidies or minor rule changes for your company or industry, and less about the overall health of the economy. So those two trends have made short-term special interest seeking it very just become the norm for most companies. And now it has become what you have to do. So companies, in a way, are stuck, having set a precedent, and it’s hard to unwind. They are feeling more of a shakedown from politicians with their hands out than a special advantage at this point, and what they don’t remember is it hasn’t always been this way, and we could change it.
This is one place where the long-term and short-term conflict, and responsible leaders will look for rules that healthy competitive markets that reward real value for society. Companies are also increasingly going to be held accountable for alignment in our current environment, which constantly sets them up for hypocrisy traps, and where it’s really hard to pursue your interests and play the game the way it’s played federally or at the state level. Companies are asking how they can realistically engage and be aligned with what they say the’re committed to with their stakeholders. In fact, more shareholder resolutions are pushing for alignment, which is very very difficult in the current environment One way out is to start to work on those underlying foundations that make the whole system work better, like less emphasis on paying for access and more emphasis on good ideas and things that help elected officials serve their constituents. Not easy or without friction, but definitely a better way to engage.
We think companies are starting to see that option. They need to help the fundamental systems work better to get out of the hypocrisy traps for themselves, and drive growth and opportunity for society. Beyond market rules, companies have an interest in a well-functioning constitutional democracy, where citizens trust that their institutions represent their interests. Companies have influence on that. Companies depend on effective civil discourse and an informed public, and they have an influence on that. So those are some of the leverage points companies can consider, to see if what they’re doing is strengthening these systems or corroding them. By working to strengthen those, they will be aligning incentives with real value for the long term, which has an enormous impact on the the environment."
"There are probably fewer local newspapers in Britain now than at any time since the 18th century. More people get local news and information – or misinformation – from social media. A long-term decline has accelerated: more than 320 local titles closed between 2009 and 2019 as advertising revenues fell by about 70%. The pandemic was another blow. At least as serious as these disappearances is the hollowing out of titles that have seen staffing, resources and pagination slashed, and coverage thus diminished. It is harder to quantify when court reporting is replaced by write-ups of press releases, or generic national stories topped-and-tailed with a little local colour, but it is obvious to readers.
Publications are less and less likely to be owned by proprietors with a stake in their communities, and more and more by big conglomerates prioritising the extraction of cash. More than two-thirds of UK titles are held by the three largest publishers, leaving about 400 independents. Now production costs are rocketing and businesses are cutting back further on advertising. While individual reporters and organisations still do remarkable work, they do it against the odds.
This is a global problem. Newspapers in the US are closing at the rate of two a week. Local newspapers were never perfect: they could reflect community prejudices, or cosy up to authorities and businesses they should have challenged. But the social costs of losing coverage genuinely rooted in communities is profound, and “news deserts” – without a reliable source of local news – tend to be places deprived in other ways.
Local news organisations encourage people to use businesses, go to theatres or join campaigning groups. They inform people about rights and services. They promote accountability and democratic oversight – even more important when power is devolved. But they also sustain communities in less tangible ways. They make people feel part of society. They allow them to assess what they read in the context of their own experience, and encourage them to see news as a source of practical and helpful information, rather than a matter of theoretical discussion and emotional reaction. Margaret Sullivan, the US media critic (and now a Guardian US columnist) warns that their erosion is a danger to democracy itself. It allows disinformation and emotive political rhetoric detached from fact to flourish.
There is plenty of evidence that people value local news and its many benefits. There is less evidence that they will pay enough to make it sustainable. Some hope can be found in newer independents such as the Bristol Cable, a cooperative, Manchester’s the Mill and sister titles the Post (Liverpool) and the Tribune (Sheffield). Run on a shoestring, they provide a valuable service, but to relatively niche audiences. January’s report on the sustainability of local journalism from the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee offered helpful suggestions. The local democracy reporting service – under which the BBC funds journalists at other regional organisations – has proved more effective than anticipated in pursuing public interest reporting, but could be expanded and given more bite.
The government’s new tech regulator, the Digital Markets Unit, should make sure that small publishers are fairly paid by the big digital platforms. And the pilot news information fund set up after the 2019 Cairncross review of the sustainability of journalism should be much expanded and made permanent. There is no single easy fix. But public funding is a crucial part of the mix."
"English football is to take a new direction after the government confirmed plans for an independent regulator of the game, but crucial concerns over financial redistribution may yet hinder any progress.
On Thursday the government will present its white paper on football governance in the men’s elite game to the House of Commons. Its plan is to create a regulator “established in law to oversee the financial sustainability of the game and put fans back at the heart of how football is run”. Following a period of consultation, those plans will be the turned into legislation “as soon as parliamentary time allows”, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says.
Among the regulator’s powers will be the control of licensing, with clubs having to prove their solvency and “sound financial business models” before being allowed to compete. The regulator will also oversee a new test for owners and directors designed to ensure “good custodians of clubs” and “stronger due diligence on sources of wealth”. It will also be able to stop clubs from joining breakaway competitions such as the European Super League, while fans will have a voice on matters of “heritage”.
All these powers were largely expected, and broadly welcomed by the game’s key stakeholders. The FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said he endorsed the white paper’s “commitment to improving the financial sustainability and governance of professional clubs”. The Premier League said the publication of the white paper was a “significant moment for English football” and that it recognised “the case for change in football governance”. The EFL called it “a landmark moment for the future of our game”.
Football authorities were joined by politicians in offering their endorsement. Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, said: “We know there are real challenges which threaten the stability of clubs both big and small. These bold new plans … will safeguard the beautiful game for future generations.” The shadow DCMS secretary, Lucy Powell, said “Football reform has support across parliament, and across the country”, although she added that the government should “urgently bring forward legislation, or take responsibility for any clubs that go under.”
Beneath the welcome for plans that – in broad terms – conform with the recommendations made by Tracey Crouch’s fan-led review 18 months ago, tension remains. The white paper will confirm that the regulator is to be given backstop powers to force the EFL, Premier League and FA to agree a new financial settlement for the game. That too was a recommendation of the fan-led review, but in the intervening months the parties have not been able to agree upon anything approximating a solution.
For the EFL the situation is clear: the football pyramid needs more money from the Premier League. The Premier League believes it gives enough money already, but will consider an increase. The mechanism for such a deal remains out of reach, however, with the Premier League rejecting the latest idea from the EFL to close the gap in prize money between the top flight and the Championship by changing the scale at which clubs are paid.
The EFL says the winner of the two divisions should receive twice as much as the team that finishes bottom, which would close the disparity in prize money between 20th in the Premier League and the winner of the Championship by half. The Premier League, however, is not willing to change its current ratio of 1.65 to 1, seen by many as a secret of the competition’s success as it maintains a more level playing field.
The campaigner and former chairman of the FA, David Bernstein, said the white paper may have missed an opportunity to enforce a settlement on parties who cannot see eye to eye. Bernstein added that redistribution is an issue the game “has tried to sort out without agreement” and that negotiations are “an unequal struggle” that favours the Premier League.
“Resolving this questions should be directly part of the regulator’s brief,” said Bernstein, a central voice in calling for an independent regulator, “otherwise, there will be a void.”
The FA also vocalised their concerns over redistribution. The fan-led review recommended that more money should go from the Premier League not only to the EFL but the grassroots game. In responding to the white paper, Bullingham insisted that this commitment should not be forgotten. “The players, referees, coaches and volunteers in grassroots football are the foundations of the English game, and it is important that an independent regulator recognises this and supports the long term health of the whole game”, he said.
However, the proposals were met with a furious response from West Ham’s co-owner David Sullivan. On Wednesday night Sky Sports’ chief reporter, Kaveh Solhekol, reported Sullivan saying: “It’s a terrible idea. The government are terrible at running everything. Look at the mess the country’s in. We pay the highest taxes for the worst service from the worst government I’ve seen in my life. The regulator will have a huge staff that football will have to pay for. It will be a total waste of money.”"

"The number of births registered in Japan plummeted to another record low last year – the latest worrying statistic in a decades-long decline that the country’s authorities have failed to reverse despite their extensive efforts.
The country saw 799,728 births in 2022, the lowest number on record and the first ever dip below 800,000, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Health on Tuesday. That number has nearly halved in the past 40 years; by contrast, Japan recorded more than 1.5 million births in 1982.
Japan also reported a record high for post-war deaths last year, at more than 1.58 million.
Deaths have outpaced births in Japan for more than a decade, posing a growing problem for leaders of the world’s third-largest economy. They now face a ballooning elderly population, along with a shrinking workforce to fund pensions and health care as demand from the aging population surges.
Japan’s population has been in steady decline since its economic boom of the 1980s and stood at 125.5 million in 2021, according to the most recent government figures.
Its fertility rate of 1.3 is far below the rate of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population, in the absence of immigration.
The country also has one of the highest life expectancies in the world; in 2020, nearly one in 1,500 people in Japan were age 100 or older, according to government data.
These concerning trends prompted a warning in January from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida that Japan is “on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.”
“In thinking of the sustainability and inclusiveness of our nation’s economy and society, we place child-rearing support as our most important policy,” he said, adding that Japan “simply cannot wait any longer” in solving the problem of its low birth rate.
A new government agency will be set up in April to focus on the issue, with Kishida saying in January that he wants the government to double its spending on child-related programs.
But money alone might not be able to solve the multi-pronged problem, with various social factors contributing to the low birth rate.
Japan’s high cost of living, limited space and lack of child care support in cities make it difficult to raise children, meaning fewer couples are having kids. Urban couples are also often far from extended family in other regions, who could help provide support.
In 2022, Japan was ranked one of the world’s most expensive places to raise a child, according to research from financial institution Jefferies. And yet, the country’s economy has stalled since the early 1990s, meaning frustratingly low wages and little upward mobility.
The average real annual household income declined from 6.59 million yen ($50,600) in 1995 to 5.64 million yen ($43,300) in 2020, according to 2021 data from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
Attitudes toward marriage and starting families have also shifted in recent years, with more couples putting off both during the pandemic – and young people feeling increasingly pessimistic about the future.
It’s a familiar story throughout East Asia, where South Korea’s fertility rate – already the world’s lowest – dropped yet again last year in the latest setback to the country’s efforts to boost its declining population.
Meanwhile, China is inching closer to officially losing its title as the world’s most populous country to India after its population shrank in 2022 for the first time since the 1960s."
"Of all the news trickling out of Mobile World Congress this year, the most interesting products were either foldables or rollables. It’s a showcase of a lot of eye-catching phones and devices that often don’t make it to America, but that doesn’t mean we can’t look on in envy or use this as a possible preview of the technology that will shape future phones in the US.
One of the first foldables we saw out of MWC was Oppo’s Find N2 Flip. This thing is basically the Chinese company’s version of Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 4, except its external screen is in portrait instead of landscape orientation. It’s currently the largest cover screen on a flip-style foldable, at 3.26 inches. This makes the Find N2 Flip easier to use when framing up selfies with the device closed and, thanks to its size, allows for more lines of messages to be read.
Oddly, though, the home screen here doesn’t take advantage of the larger canvas and its clock widget actually uses a smaller font than the Galaxy Z Flip 4. The company did take pains to emphasize that the crease on the Find N2 Flip’s screen is 65 percent less visible than the last generation. According to Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith, though, you can still see the little wrinkle, so … [[shrug]]
For those of us in the US, this comparison is more of a theoretical exercise since the Oppo phone won’t be available stateside, retailing only in Europe and China. If you still want more details on this device, make sure to check out Mat’s hands-on.
This week, we also learned that Honor’s Magic VS is coming to more parts of the world. Specifically, it’ll be coming to Europe for 1,599 Euros, or about $1,690. This is the first time since we saw a prototype in December that the company is sharing availability info outside of China.
The Magic VS is similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4, which is to say that it is a regular-sized smartphone that opens up to become a roughly 8-inch tablet. It’s not a brand new product at MWC, but it’s nice to see more information about more foldable phones giving Samsung some competition in the space.
It’s not just Oppo and Honor ramping up the competition, either. Relatively lesser known phone maker Tecno showed up at MWC with the Phantom V Fold — a more affordable foldable with fairly impressive specs. The Phantom V Fold has a 7.85-inch screen on the inside with the company touting a “virtually crease-free” display like Oppo did.
Senior editor Richard Lai said that at the right angle, the wrinkle is certainly not obvious and it’s better than Samsung’s, but he added that it’s still not as subtle as the Xiaomi Mix Fold 2. On the outside, the Phantom has a 6.42-inch Full HD panel, as well as a round camera hump housing a triple-sensor imaging system. The main and telephoto cameras are 50-megapixels, while the ultra-wide setup is 13MP. There’s also a pair of punch-hole cameras on the two screens.
The Phantom V Fold is powered by the same MediaTek Dimensity 9000+ processor as the one in the Oppo Find N2 Flip, and for the base model that comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, the company is charging $1,099. Compared to the Samsung and Oppo versions of tablet-sized foldables, that’s hundreds of dollars less. But again, as with so many products that were announced at MWC this year, the Phantom V Fold will not be coming to the US. It’ll be available to those in India, Latin America and parts of Africa where Tecno is typically active.
The fact that we’re reaching a point where foldables are starting to get relatively affordable means, unfortunately, that they’re about to become common. And therefore, they’re going to be passe. So 2022. In 2023, the hot buzzword is rollables. At least, based on the concept devices Lenovo and Motorola brought to MWC.
Lenovo showed off a laptop with a screen that extends upwards and away from the keyboard, and the prototype itself appeared impressively thin and sturdy. Meanwhile, Motorola brought back its Rizr concept device and this second version has a 5-inch display that rolls out to hit 6.5 inches when you need a larger canvas for video or a long Best of Redditor Updates post. The device that was shown off in Barcelona appeared to work, but multiple outlets like ArsTechnica and Techcrunch expressed reservations about build quality so… Don’t be surprised if this format never comes to market.
It’s not like Motorola and Lenovo are the first companies to try rolling screens, by the way. Far from it. LG and TCL have made various prototypes showcasing different form factors with flexible, sliding and rolling screens. In fact, LG’s first rolling screens prototypes showed up as far back as CES 2014. It’s clear manufacturers know smartphones have gotten good enough that people don’t want to buy a new one every year or two, and are trying to find a new shape that will entice shoppers this decade. The current camera and software race between Apple, Google and Samsung is starting to induce yawns, and the new features they are adding aren’t particularly exciting.
Other phone makers have spent the last few years focusing on battery and charging tech, and we saw some of that at MWC this year too. Xiaomi showed off a demo of 300-watt charging that could fully charge a device in just 5 minutes. Meanwhile, Realme shared global release information about its GT3, which is compatible with 240W charging and can get completely juiced in just under 10 minutes. OnePlus also showcased a concept phone with a liquid cooling system that would allow improved performance and charging times. With the drops in temperature that this should bring, OnePlus could deliver boosts to games by three to four frames per second, as well as saving 30 to 45 seconds of charging time.
Besides new formats and battery tech, we also saw companies focus on sustainability and repairability. The Nokia G22, for example, is the result of a collaboration between parent company HMD and iFixit, and follows in the footsteps of Apple, Google and Samsung in offering official repair guides and parts. As Right to Repair bills and laws get passed in multiple states in the US and elsewhere in the world, this looks to be a growing trend in mobile phones that can help us be more environmentally conscious.
There was plenty of other news out of the show, including Xiaomi’s new concept AR glasses, and you can get all the details here."
"Xbox's February Update has arrived, here's what's inside
Sustainability options, a new Xbox Home background feature, and more await.
What you need to know
- Microsoft has announced that the Xbox February Update is rolling out today. The update's core focus is refining the Xbox user experience and the introduction of some new features.
- The largest addition of the update is the arrival of carbon aware downloads, which could potentially cut down on carbon emissions since they'll occur during nightly maintenance windows when more electricity is coming from lower-carbon sources.
- It's now also possible to hide game art when navigating the Xbox Home screen. This keeps your background a solid color of your choice instead of making it show game art when you highlight game tiles.
- Remote controlling your Xbox console with the Google Home app is also now an option, and serves as an alternative for the Google Assistant voice command functionality that Xbox has had since 2019.
- Lastly, a random group of users have been granted the ability to quickly recreate past Xbox Parties by selecting them in the Party History menu. This is part of Microsoft's plan to experiment with this feature moving forward.
Microsoft has announced that the Xbox February Update is being pushed live, with its worldwide rollout starting today. The core focus of the update is refining the Xbox user experience and introducing new features.
The biggest additions of the update are carbon aware downloads, which are the result of the carbon negativity changes Microsoft announced last month. This will allow you to set your Xbox console to schedule game, app, and OS downloads during specific nightly maintenance windows based on local carbon intensity data. In its post (opens in new tab), Microsoft says this could lower carbon emissions, as at these times, more electricity comes from sources with less carbon. Notably, Microsoft has also committed to planting and raising a tree for a decade for every two consoles that switch from the Sleep power option to Shutdown, which cuts power use by up to 20 times.
The update also makes it possible to hide game art while navigating the Home screen, giving users more control over their Xbox UI. By toggling this new option in the Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Solid color and game art menu, game art will no longer replace your background when you select a game tile. Instead, the background will remain a solid color of your choice.
Additionally, it's now possible to use the Google Home app as a touch-enabled remote control for Xbox Series X, Series S, and One systems, giving fans an alternative to Google Assistant voice commands. Once you link your console to Google Home, you can use the app for turning your Xbox on or off, UI navigation, media playback, and more. The full list of remote control features include:
- Power on/off
- Directional navigation
- Navigate home
- Navigate back
- Play/pause
- Skip/previous
- Volume up/down
- Mute/unmute
- Record game clip
Finally, the update has also given a random number of users the ability to quickly recreate a previous Xbox Party as part of Microsoft's plan to experiment with this feature. If you got access, you can try this out by going to the Parties & Chats tab in your Xbox console's guide. Then, select Party or Party History, and a list of previous Parties you were in will appear. You can then select one and opt to recreate it, selecting which friends you'd like to invite.
Windows Central's take
Overall, I think this is a great update. The addition of carbon aware downloads is awesome, especially since many Xbox gamers already download their updates overnight anyway. The option to disable game art on the Home screen will be appreciated by those that find it distracting or just want a simple background, and the ability to use Google Home as a remote control for your console is nice, too.
I'm also a big fan of the Xbox Party recreation idea, though it's clear a complete version of this feature isn't ready yet since Microsoft is only making it available to some users for now. Remember that if you're interested in being an early tester for new Xbox features, you should sign up for the Xbox Insider Program (opens in new tab).

"- About 1 in 5 Americans live in areas with policies for decarbonizing buildings, an analysis found.
- A multiyear push to eliminate fossil fuels from new construction has spread to nearly 100 cities.
- Buildings account for 13% of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
This article is part of Insider's weekly newsletter on sustainability, written by Catherine Boudreau, senior sustainability reporter. Sign up here.
Policies across the US aimed at eliminating fossil fuels from new homes and buildings have piled up fast since Berkeley, California, became the first US city to ban gas hookups in 2019.
Similar policies have spread to nearly 100, mostly liberal, municipalities in 11 states that either require or encourage the switch to electric heating, cooling, and cooking, according to an analysis published this month by the Building Decarbonization Coalition. As of this year, one in five Americans — some 72.5 million people — live in areas covered by those policies.
""We finally had a chance to take a breath and look at how fast things are changing,"" Panama Bartholomy, the executive director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for eliminating fossil fuels from buildings to combat the climate crisis, told Insider. ""I am really surprised and impressed by this movement.""
The report came shortly after a debate over gas stoves captured national attention when a federal official floated the idea of banning them over public-health concerns. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said it wouldn't ban the appliance but that it was looking for ways to reduce hazards from pollutants like carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration, under the Inflation Reduction Act, is set to hand out billions of dollars to states later this year so they can offer rebates and tax breaks to consumers who want to make the switch to electric and help reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Buildings account for 13% of US emissions, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency.
The electrification push might already be having an influence on the market, Bartholomy said. While most Americans — an estimated 62% — already cook with electricity, the same isn't true for heating. But last year, for the first time, US shipments of electric heat pumps consistently outpaced gas furnaces, the coalition's analysis found. Heat pumps both warm and cool a home or building by circulating heat from indoors to outdoors and back again. They are more energy-efficient than furnaces that run on gas or fuel oil and can save people money on their utility bills.
Maine might be partially responsible for the trend. The state has already surpassed a goal set in 2019 to install 100,000 heat pumps in homes and businesses. So far, 116,000 have been installed, according to Efficiency Maine, a quasi-state agency.
The effort is part of Maine's broader goal to be carbon-neutral by 2045. About 30% of the state's emissions are from buildings, the majority of which burn fuel oil for heat.
States like California, Washington, and Colorado have gone even further. California and Washington, as of this year, have building codes that require new buildings to support all-electric appliances. A Colorado law set a 20% emissions-reduction target for buildings by 2030.
Still, headwinds remain for the electrification push. GOP-controlled legislatures in 20 states passed laws banning local governments from banning natural-gas hookups. These states account for almost one-third of US natural-gas demand for buildings, an S&P Global analysis found, saying existing gas demand wasn't at risk.
Bartholomy said he wasn't deterred, especially now that Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York has proposed a statewide ban on gas in new buildings.
""California and New York together have an outsized role in demand for gas supplies and appliances,"" Bartholomy said."
"Interviews
Lisa Says Gah's Recipe for Success: Slow Fashion, Sustainability & Snacky Prints
This West Coast brand has us saying gah in all the right ways.
This article is part of an interview series called Ladies Who (Wear) Lunch, an exploration of the intersection of food and fashion.
I remember the first time I really saw myself in a brand—it was the late 90s, I was in 3rd grade (maybe 4th), and I absolutely needed the Lisa Frank trapper keeper that was so hot in the halls of my elementary school that year. Naturally, my mom refused to buy it for me and I was devastated. Clearly she didn’t understand that those neon animal prints and psychedelic rainbow swirls spoke to me on a cellular level. I was them, they were me.
Fast-forward a few decades to me finding that same feeling while scrolling through the fanciful-patterned pages of the Lisa Says Gah site, only this time I didn’t need my mom’s approval to make a purchase. Founded in 2014 by Lisa Bühler, what was once a small e-commerce destination for decidedly anti-fast fashion, independent designers, and community has evolved into a brick-and-mortar boasting, in-house design-making, and overall joy-inducing operation. With a name like theirs, defined on the brand’s website as an “unbridled outbursting of surprise and delight,” I couldn’t wait to sit down with Lisa to get the scoop on snack-filled designs, sustainability in fashion (and food), and the things that make her say, “GAH!”
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
MADISON TRAPKIN: Can you describe your ideal lunch date? Where are you going? What are you eating and what are you wearing?
LISA BÜHLER: It's definitely warm outside, but comfortable. We're probably going to have to be in Italy, maybe Tuscany. I think I'm wearing some sort of fruit food print, probably in a breezy linen fabric. I would probably be wanting to meet with someone new, not really knowing anything about the person, but having similar experiences. For food, I would say juicy tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, and unsalted bread are on the table—lots of small dishes coming and going.
MT: The unsalted bread is so classic Tuscany.
LB: I know! I got used to it when I lived there and now it's so special to me.
MT: Where did you live in Tuscany?
LB: I studied abroad in Florence, and then kind of lived there on and off for a few years. I was in my early 20s and it was my first real time out of the country. I think the food and the culture there really influenced a lot of the things I do now, looking back.
MT: Last year's Italian Summer collection makes so much sense now, and I bet it felt very personal to you!
LB: Yes, for sure.
MT: Can you tell me the Lisa Says Gah origin story?
LB: We actually just turned eight! Back in 2014, I moved to San Francisco with my then-boyfriend (he's now my husband) after leaving a job that I really loved. I thought I’d consult for a while and I did, but coming out of fast fashion, I really wanted to focus on small, independent designers. At that time, sustainability wasn’t even a word that was thrown around [in fashion], and it seemed like all the sustainable options were really expensive and kind of for an older audience. I wanted something fun, punchy, and relatable in a way that felt very peer-to-peer, like you were shopping with a friend online.
We've launched a lot of amazing brands and we started our own in-house line a few years after that, starting with deadstock fabrics and just kind of testing things. We used to use a factory in San Francisco, but then a few years later the pandemic happened and we weren't really sure what direction it was going to take. We were only online, which we learned was beneficial for us, but we did have some [COVID-related] problems with manufacturing. We started moving our production down to L.A. and then we moved our warehouse down there last summer. We opened our brick-and-mortar this past fall, and we still have lots of amazing brands. Our in-house collection has really expanded and we've really kind of found our niche in point of view through print and a lot of fun collaborations.
MT: Did you always know that food would somehow come into your work?
LB: We always used to photograph outside my first apartment-slash-office, and there was a fruit stand called Courtney's Produce around the corner. It felt like what our customers might be doing on the weekends or what we imagined ourselves doing, on vacation or out at the farmer's market, so that's where we shot. I also think food can be nostalgic and trigger memories or make new ones—it's all about that community and experience, and fashion shares a similar feeling.
MT: There's a lot of overlap between the food and the fashion industries, which I want to talk about in a question or two, but first I’m dying to know more about these incredible food-themed collections at LSG.
LB: Well, Cin Cin comes to mind first because I remember driving home from work and thinking about how we're so strong with our spring and summer prints, but winter prints can be a little bit more of a challenge for me personally. The spring and summer prints come so easily, fruit and florals just make sense. On that drive, the idea of cocktails (still a kind of decorative consumable) popped into my head. It felt like it would be especially fun because this was the first big holiday season [since COVID] when people were really going out and having a good time.
MT: Exciting takes on winter food can be very challenging, like I guess you could do a dress with potatoes and onions on it, but summer produce is much more fun. Who designs your prints?
LB: We work with a print designer, Leanne Kissinger. She’s basically on retainer for us. She does all of our prints now and she's so creative and great to work with. We start with the concept and then work together from there on the design.
MT: I think that you met that very unique challenge of winter designs in such a beautiful way this year. At LSG, you're all about ethically made apparel, plus you’re anti-fast fashion and pro-community, which all has some serious parallels with the food world. How do your choices in business and fashion align with your choices in food and ingredients?
LB: Living in Italy was a big exposure to me for homemade, local goods because that's just how they do it there. I grew up in a suburb of L.A., so it was like, all chain restaurants, TGI Friday’s, spots like that. Once I found that food could be really special, taste really good, and that it doesn't necessarily have to be fancy and expensive, I started supporting local vendors more, which I also do through fashion. We support new designers [at LSG] and it's so fulfilling to work with new brands that don't have a platform because we can give that to them. With food, I support a lot of small restaurants here in San Francisco and L.A., which is easy to do because there are plenty to choose from. And I go to farmer's markets daily.
MT: Do you like to cook?
LB: I really love cooking. For me, it's kind of like reading—when I do it, it feeds my soul. I can't get distracted and it requires hands-on focus, so I just get in the zone. I think I love the process of it, but I don't do it as much as I'd like because I have two little humans running around my home. They're 1½ and 3, so when I get home it's like quick, quick feed.
My mom makes this great elbow macaroni spaghetti with beef, and it’s homemade but so simple. Recently I was like, ""What is that delicious thing you make that I never thought to ask about before?"" So I'm starting to find recipes like that, ones that are simple but still taste really good and are fun for the whole fam.
MT: Even if it's simple, you're still doing the act. You're still cooking, which is a little meditative, a little therapeutic. And feeding your family, which is really special.
LB: Mm-hmm. Actually, my husband and I have a cabin up in Mendocino and it's off-grid, so we have to cook up there. It's been fun to have time to cook when we visit and hopefully when the kids are a bit older and they can help me.
MT: What's your favorite off-the-grid thing you've created lately when you've been there?
LB: Chili. It's hearty and great when it’s cold and the fire's going. Plus it makes many, many servings.
MT: Definitely a great cold-weather, off-grid food. Are there any dishes or drinks that have made you say, “Gah” lately?
LB: Lately I'm all about egg white beverages. Like, I love a Whiskey Sour. They're just so unexpected. Food-wise, I recently went to a friend’s launch and they had a table full of candelabras, beautiful cheese plates, pears dipped in chocolate with little ribbons on top, and this beautiful cake. Everything was so thoughtful and delicious. The food was so beautiful and a part of the experience visually. I'm excited to see that more.
MT: I love that, too! They’re like edible food installations that aren’t so precious that you don't want to touch them.
LB: I think that's feeling really cool right now and so creative. It's like art.
MT: Food is art, art is food, which brings us to the final question. What does the future look like for LSG?
LB: Well, we have a tapas print coming out.
MT: Tapas!?
LB: It's so cute. It's a lot of seafood [and] more Spanish-inspired tapas. It's definitely kind of a segue from Italian Summer, but a little bit of a different direction.
MT: Spanish summer, I love it. You could keep going with that and feature a different culture’s warm-weather food traditions every summer.
LB: I know. I'm like, ""Where are we going next year?"" And also, I would actually like to start going to said places!

"Students at the University of Cambridge have voted to support a transition to a solely vegan menu across its catering services.
The Cambridge students’ union voted on Monday to hold talks about removing all animal products from its cafes and canteens with the university’s catering services.
However, the move does not guarantee that Cambridge’s catering services will go fully vegan, as that power lies with the university. It also does not apply to the university’s 31 colleges, although the campaign said it provided “an extremely strong mandate for colleges to begin transitioning to 100% plant-based menus”.
The group’s motion, which calls for the change in response to “climate and biodiversity crises”, was backed by 72% of non-abstaining student representatives who voted after a four-week consultation process. It comes after lobbying from Cambridge’s Plant-Based Universities campaign, which is supported by Animal Rebellion.
William Smith, 24, from the Cambridge branch of the Plant-Based Universities campaign, said: “It’s great that Cambridge students’ union has passed our motion to work with the university to implement a just and sustainable plant-based catering system.
“By removing animal products from its menus, the university could significantly reduce its environmental impact and showcase to the world its commitment to sustainability.
“The university catering services has already made important strides, for example in 2016 when it removed beef and lamb from all its menus. We look forward to working with them on the next necessary steps.”
The Plant-Based Universities campaign is a nationwide initiative of students who are pushing for their universities and student unions to adopt fully plant-based catering, and has offshoots at more than 40 institutions.
A University of Cambridge spokesperson said: “The University of Cambridge removed ruminant meat from the menu in all university catering Service cafes in 2016 and has a sustainable food policy which also seeks to actively promote plant-based options, remove unsustainable fish from the menu and reduce food waste. We always welcome suggestions from students and staff.”"
"Every interaction between a company and a customer is an opportunity. For the company, it’s a chance to reinforce brand quality and value with the goal of achieving customer satisfaction and loyalty. For the customer, it’s a chance to provide input on their needs, satisfaction with previous experiences, and expectations for future engagements with your brand.
Your customer’s journey involves every interaction with your company and its brands — every node (e.g., company), every actor (e.g., customer), and every link (e.g., exchange between buyer and seller) in that journey affects their satisfaction and loyalty. Customers want to experience and engage on their terms, and they expect seamless integration of online and in-person interactions with your company.
This raises the question: How can companies best organize and position their marketing, product development, and customer support to create a compelling customer experience? Based on a collection of my recent managerial research — involving thousands of companies and analyses of millions of customer data points from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) — here are the areas leaders should focus on to create and manage compelling customer experiences throughout the customer journey.
1. Orchestrating the Marketing Ecosystem
Gone are the days when converting customers was merely a matter of beating your competitors. Today’s competitive companies take an active role in orchestrating their position in a marketing ecosystem to influence the customer journey.
Marketing ecosystems grow by co-evolving with one or more company’s growth. This is fueled by digital technology, embracing knowledge, intelligent integration, and resource sharing for critical activity links within the ecosystem. Co-creation and resource sharing (e.g., customer data) related to creating a compelling customer experience positively push companies to grow with the ecosystem.
For example, Starbucks varies its approach to global expansion depending on the marketing ecosystem it’s operating within. Because India is a heavy tea market, Starbucks opted to not develop its offering within the coffee market. It relied on its joint venture partner’s (Tata’s) supply chain, distribution, fulfillment networks, and market-specific resources. Starbucks focused on leveraging its brand and resource complementarity with Tata in the growing Indian metro markets. Meanwhile in China, Starbucks gained insights from regional ecosystem partners that indicated that it’s viewed as an aspirational brand for young middle-class Chinese individuals. This enabled the company to anticipate market developments and changing consumer tastes.
2. Aligning Company and Customer Needs
Marketing is fundamental to your company’s efforts to create a compelling customer experience, so you must do more to ensure that managers and customer-centric employees (e.g., frontline customer service, sales, and customer experience management personnel) understand how customers perceive your company’s brands, products, and services — and why.
Many companies have a lot of work to do to create a better alignment between the company’s and customers’ wants and needs. More often than not, managers underestimate customers’ expectations and overestimate their satisfaction and loyalty to their brands. This is made worse because managers, on average, also underestimate the importance of customers’ perceptions of quality in driving satisfaction, as well as the importance of satisfaction in driving both loyalty and complaints.
3. Delivering Amazing Customer Convenience
Customers want to be able to buy the product they need at a time and place that’s convenient to them. They expect companies to solve this time/place convenience so that the purchasing experience is seamlessly part of their journey. Today’s ever-accelerating demands by customers for convenience will be a benefit to agile companies and likely painful for unresponsive ones.
A company that can create a competitive strategic mix of speed, quality, cost, and flexibility can thrive in its marketing ecosystem and align with customers’ goals more effectively. Such an alignment often enables companies to provide an amazing customer experience.
4. Reinforcing Digital Marketing
There are important differences between customers’ online and in-person experiences. Online customers view the purchase value (i.e., product quality relative to the price) as a significant attribute when rating satisfaction, and they are more satisfaction-sensitive when making repurchase decisions. This means that online customers have to be satisfied at a higher level to repurchase a product, compared with brick-and-mortar customer who may repurchase a product, at times, even if they were not highly satisfied with their previous purchase. But the quality of the customer experience is a stronger driver of satisfaction in the brick-and-mortar scenario than online.
Social media is one way to align the company’s and customers’ needs, create an embedded and compelling customer experience, and facilitate high levels of customer satisfaction. However, customer-initiated posts have been shown to be the most important in influencing potential buyers, and there are limits to a company’s ability to influence customers by initiating social media conversations about themselves.
5. Adjusting Customer Incentives
Countries, companies, and customers are increasingly concerned with sustainability. Leaders should consider the following questions: How much cost can be tolerated for sustainability efforts? And how sensitive are customers to the possibility of increased prices due to sustainability efforts?
Many companies implement sustainability initiatives and maintain competitive prices. Research shows that a company’s costs and product prices can increase by 27% to 72%, and the company can remain competitive in its industry. Price competitiveness is the fiercest in the United States — at most, companies can add a 27% price premium, on average, to products in the U.S. without a negative impact on a company’s product-market performance. In South America, the price increase can be up to 69% above normal cost without significant detrimental effects on a company’s product-market performance.
But increasing costs and prices should not be done in perpetuity. Creating compelling customer experiences can be a more viable strategy. Companies can offer a mixed-incentive bundle of sustainability options and let the customer choose. Such incentivizing increases the satisfaction positives of participants and eliminates the negative effect perceived by non-participants.
6. Cultivating Customer Evangelists
Many customers increasingly want to engage with brands. A company’s reputation, its brands, and related science-based customer insights can be used to build trust as the foundation for such interactions. But a quality brand on its own isn’t sufficient to create compelling customer engagement. Customer-centric companies develop a culture in which employees are encouraged to develop deeper and more long-lasting relationships with customers.
Customer service expert Shep Hyken talks about creating an amazing customer experience that leverages very satisfied customers as “customer evangelists.” He says: “The customer experience comes in part from service, but in the larger sense it is everything created by any and all contact with your operation.” If a company can maximize the positives from the interactions in every node (e.g., companies involved, supply chain partners, customers) in the customer journey, customers can be nurtured into repeatedly coming back and potentially becoming promoters and evangelists.
7. Handling Customer Complaints
Companies should appreciate customers who complain. But complaints take time and effort to resolve and can be a significant drain on the company’s resources. The positive is that companies that handle complaints superbly can gain stronger customer loyalty than before the complaint.
Companies that take complaints seriously typically develop more competitive brands and are often better equipped than other companies to create a compelling customer experience. Complaint handling has to be almost perfect (nine or above on a 10-point scale, where 10 is the best) for customers to come back and be as satisfied as before they complained. Based on ACSI data, very few companies can achieve this level of complaint handling. The reason is that a customer who complains to a company is negatively predisposed toward the company and its brands. Turning that customer into a satisfied and repeat customer is difficult.
Unfortunately, many dissatisfied customers opt not to complain. Over the last three decades, ACSI data show that 12.8% of customers formally complained to companies but, in reality, 30% of customers complained more informally about brands on social media. These non-complaining but disgruntled customers instead leave the company and buy substitute products. The takeaway is that it is often better to have customers complain than not complain (and simply leave) if the company can handle the complaint in a satisfactory way without draining resources.
8. Managing Product Returns
Between 5% to 10% of customers who buy products from brick-and-mortar stores return the products, depending on the industry. The returns rise to 15% to 40% for online purchases (with clothing and shoes bought online having returns of 30% to 40%). These data points are important since product returns are about to be an annual trillion-dollar industry. This puts pressure on companies to get it right from the start but also puts pressure on reverse logistics in companies’ supply chains.
To create a compelling customer experience and offset the potential for these high and costly rates of product returns, companies need strategic insights into which factors increase customers’ return propensity. For example, research has shown that shopping via mobile apps can lead to lower return rates than both brick-and-mortar and computer-based online shopping. Also, in product categories in which customers can learn from their return experiences — for example, clothing — product returns positively increase future purchases, because customers have gained direct experience with the products. These types of scientific insights can assist companies in leveraging customer learning and return management as competitive weapons in the customer journey.

Creating and managing compelling customer experiences are becoming as important for a company as creating and managing the company’s brands portfolio (i.e., products and services). A compelling customer experience, if achieved, will be evident in a company’s performance metrics, such as positive effects on customers’ mindsets (e.g., satisfaction, loyalty), customers’ behaviors (e.g., acquisition, retention), product-market performance (e.g., market share), and financial outcomes (e.g., lifetime value)."

"Update to Kagi Search pricing
It has been a while since our last update, and we have been busy with three main large-scale initiatives: a new pricing model that ensures Kagi’s sustainability, new plans including Family plans, and enhancing search experience with generative AI tools.
We remain committed to being 100% user-supported and are pleased to unveil our revised pricing structure. This will make Kagi more accessible to a broader range of users while guaranteeing our long-term financial stability.
The new pricing plans will be effective March 15, 2023, and this blog post will go into detail of the roll-out.

Summary of changes
The current Premium plan with unmetered searches will be called “Legacy Professional” and will continue until it is renewed. After that, if you do nothing, it will be automatically replaced by “Early Adopter Professional” which includes 1,000 searches, with a charge of 1.5 cents per search beyond that limit.
For example, after the switch to Legacy Professional:
- If existing sub averages 30 searches per day (900/month), they’ll pay $10 (as “Early Adopter Professional” as it includes 1,000 searches before pay per search).
- If existing sub searches 1,100 times, they’ll pay $10 + 100 * $0.015 = $11.50 (as “Early Adopter Professional” as it includes 1,000 searches before pay per search).
The new Trial plan will be one time 100 searches.
The new Standard plan pricing will be $5/month, with 200 free searches included. This should be enough for 99% of regular Internet users and allow them to start using Kagi. (note that the most of our current users are definitely more in the 1% non-regular Internet users category😊)
The new Professional plan will be $10/month and include 700 searches.
New plans also have pay-per-use searches on demand, which are priced at 1.5 cents per search.
For example:
- If a new user averages 5 searches per day (150/month), they’ll pay $5.00.
- If a new users averages 10 searches per day (300/month), they’ll pay $5 + 100 * $0.015 = $6.50.
- If a new users averages 30 searches per day (900/month), they’ll pay $10 + 200 * $0.015 = $13.00.
We are also introducing the Ultimate plan with unmetered searches for $25/month.
You can see your current search usage in your dashboard.
More information for existing subscribers is available under existing subscribers section.
Why this change
Last September, we had a discussion about the pricing model for Kagi’s search service. While we were thrilled to have attracted a user base that is both tech-savvy and heavy users of search, the $10 per month unmetered search plan was not financially sustainable for us. We wanted to fix this by finding a pricing model to offer a fair balance for both light and heavy users.
In addition, we are excited to see how quickly generative AI has become popular in recent months. We have demonstrated the Universal Summarizer, a state-of-the-art summarizer of any content on the web, which aligns with our vision for the future of AI in search. However, incorporating generative AI into search can be expensive, so we had to consider this in our pricing model.
After three months of valuable discussions with our users on Kagi discord, we have developed a tiered pricing system that is easy to understand and ensures Kagi’s financial sustainability for the future. We want to express our gratitude to everyone who contributed to these discussions.
Details
Free plan: We are changing this from 50 monthly searches to one time 100 free searches. The main feedback we got is that people needed more time to try Kagi and set it up on all their devices. This change will address that.
Standard plan ($5/mo, 200 free searches per month included): We are excited to introduce this plan as it will allow almost everyone to start using a paid search engine and start owning their searches. Our research has shown that most internet users search around 100 times a month.
Professional plan ($10/mo, 700 free searches per month included): This plan is for Internet professionals and developers.
Pay per use: Both Standard and Professional plans include pay per use feature where searches after the included free searches are priced at 1.5 cents per search. Users will have a feature to control pay-per-use costs via customizable soft and hard limits. Reaching the soft limit triggers a notification; the hard limit prevents further searches.
Ultimate plan (unmetered searches): The new unmetered plan is now priced at $25/mo. It allows the most flexibility for the user.
Early Adopter Professional plan: Special version of the Professional plan with 1,000 included searches, available to early-adopters. Read more in the following section. As an example, if you’re an existing user with an average of 1500 queries/month, you’ll pay $10 + 500 * $0.015 = $17.50.
Legacy Professional plan: The current Kagi plan ($10/mo, unmetered) will be deprecated, but the existing subscription will be honored until renewal. Read more in the following section.
Usage for generative AI is described in more detail in the AI section.
Note Kagi has a feature to check your current search usage to get a better sense of how will the new plans affect you.
Existing subscribers
There are several perks for existing subscribers available, so make sure you read through them carefully.
Every existing subscriber will have their current subscription honored until expiration. That means if you are a subscriber at the time of the new plan rollout, you will still get unmetered searches as a part of your original Premium plan until your existing subscription expires or is set to renew.
This also means that if you are on an annual subscription plan before the pricing change on March 15, we will honor your current subscription plan all the way to its renewal.
The name for this plan will be ‘Legacy Professional’ and will be indicated as such in your billing dashboard.
One thing to note is that Legacy Professional plans will have limited access to the AI tools. At this time, we will limit usage to 50 interactions/month to keep the cost under control and adjust this as needed.
Every account with a subscription prior to or at the time of pricing change on Mar 15 will get the “Early adopter”. This will make the special “Early Adopter Professional” plan available to them instead of the regular Professional plan, with the main difference being 1,000 free included searches monthly, instead of 700, for the same $10/mo. And when the Legacy Professional plan renews, it will be automatically replaced with the “Early Adopter Professional” plan.
Family plan
We are excited to announce that the new Family plans will launch on March 29. Since the inception, Kagi has been driven by the idea of humanizing the web, especially for families and kids. We strive to provide a search engine that prioritizes the well-being of your loved ones, particularly the most vulnerable ones like children, by offering an ad-free and safe browsing experience. Our commitment to this cause was the inspiration behind the creation of Kagi.
Update (March 10): We updated the family plans based on additional community feedback.
Duo: At $14/mo, 1,000 searches included, Duo will make Kagi ideal for couples.
Family: At $20/mo, 1,500 searches included, Family allows an entire family, including kids, to enjoy Kagi’s search quality and safety.
We will write extensively about the Family plan and its unique features as we launch it on March 29.
New payment methods
We will be adding new payment methods, including Bancontact, iDEAL, Sofort as well as SEPA and direct bank debits, which should make Kagi more accessible to customers without credit cards.
Generative AI integration
Kagi has long heritage in AI, and actually started as kagi.ai in 2018. We published products, research and even a sci-fi story about AI.
Recently we’ve shown technology demonstrations for AI in search, AI in browser, Universal Summarizer, asking questions about documents in search results and many more.
Generative AI opens a new paradigm of search and a vast search space of queries that never previously existed.
We have taken special care to ensure a thoughtful user experience guided by this philosophy of AI integration:
- AI should be used in closed, defined, context relevant to search (not to be a therapist for example)
- AI should be used to enhance search experience, not to create it (similar to how we use JavaScript, meaning Kagi works perfectly fine without it)
- AI should be used to the extent that does not diminish our humanity (AI is a tool, not a replacement for brain)
We will launch three new features in Kagi on March 15, driven by generative AI.
- Summarize results - On-demand summarization of your search results
- Summarize document - On-demand summarize any page in your search results, regardless of document type or length. The Universal Summarizer will be used to power this feature. (App is currently paused, it will return with our new plan launch, see roadmap)
- Ask questions about the document - On-demand interactive chat mode where you can explore any document in your search results
Generative AI tools usage in trial, Standard, Professional and Early Adopter Professional plans will be converted into equivalent search usage according to this table:
Summarize results: 0-1 searches
Summarize document: 0-20 searches (depending on length of the document, this can process 100 page research papers or even books)
Ask questions about document: 0-20 searches (depending on the length of the document and the length of interaction)
The Legacy Professional will have a limit of 50 interactions/month. The Ultimate plan will have a 300 interactions soft limit in a month covered by Fair use policy. We will monitor actual usage and adjust these limits up or down accordingly.
Orion bundle
As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the Kagi experience, we are thrilled to introduce the Orion browser bundle. When you subscribe to Kagi, you will have the option to support the development of Orion, a zero-telemetry browser that pairs perfectly with Kagi. We are proud to say that, like Kagi, Orion is entirely user-funded. Initially, Orion will be available on macOS/iOS/iPadOS, with plans to expand to other platforms in the future.
You will also be able to manage your Orion subscription directly from your Kagi billing dashboard.
Community event
We have our first live community event on March 14 (Pi day!) at 1 pm EST in Kagi discord, event direct link.
This session will last approximately one hour and feature Vlad (CEO / Founder) and Zac (Tech Lead) to discuss pricing, AI, search and everything else. We are eager to see you all there.
Roadmap
To recap, here is the expected timeline of events:
March 14 - Community event
March 15 - New pricing plans & generative AI tools launch
March 22 - Universal Summarizer will relaunch as a standalone web app and an API (sign up to get notified when it does here)
March 29 - Family plan launch
Frequently Asked Questions
Q. Didn’t you say in September that current subscibers will be grandfathered in?
A. Yes we did say that in September. We are sorry that we have to walk back on that promise and we should have done a better job at communicating the pricing change debate that has been going on for over three months with our community.
Simple reason is that a lot of things changed since. We also said in that blog post that Kagi will cost $19/mo for all users and that is obviously not the case either. We were just wrong. A lot of things changed in the meantime that we could not anticipate and predict, namely:
- We are already losing money on most accounts. Providing a service where you lose money per customer is not advisable for any bootstrapped business, let alone in the current economic climate which is predicted to get worse.
- The model was not fair, the few people who searched less had to subsidize both people who search a lot and the free trial accounts. The new model ensures everyone pays their fair share
- Cost per search actually went up significantly since September
The decisions made (the price change and cancellation of grandfathering) is exactly the necessary step to keep us in the business of search, aligning incentives between us and users, and keeping the best interest of our users in mind.
We did the best we can, and we will still going to grandfather in everyone for up to a year on the old plan, and then on a special plan after that indefinitely (which still loses us money, just less). Discussion about this was long and hard and we made the best possible decision given our abilities and the circumstances.
Q. What’s weird to me is why resources are used to AI/Orion features that are costly to develop and use instead of focusing on getting break-even and/or product-market-fit?
A. We look at these as customer acquisition channels. Kagi spends no money on marketing and it is incredibly expensive to acquire a search engine customer. We’d rather spend money on creating long lasting products that can provide that function indefinitely (“planting the seeds”).
For example, Orion has been a major customer acquisition channel for Kagi and around 20% of our customers have found Kagi through Orion.
We expect that AI will have the same affect (for example, we gained hundreds of customers after our Universal Summarizer demo)
Q. Where does the search usage data (99% of users search less than 200 times a month) come from?
A. The average person searches Google three or four times per day. (90-120 times per month) [1] According to DuckDuckGo’s data, the monthly average is about 30 searches per person or one per day. [2] We hope that the new Standard plan will help attract some of these users.
Average Kagi user is searching 700 times per month and this is what the Professional plan is made for.
[1] Google Search Statistics [2] DuckDuckGo - How Many People Use DuckDuckGo?
Q: Why is Kagi offering a Standard plan for average search users who don’t want to pay for search?
A: While it’s true that many average search users may not be willing to pay for a search engine (yet!), we want to make our platform accessible to as many people as possible. The Standard plan is our way of providing an option for those users who may not require the advanced features of our professional plans. In addition, we have received requests from casual users and students for a starter-level plan. However, it’s important to note that our core focus remains on professionals, and they will continue to be the driving force behind our product roadmap.
Q. Do unused searches roll over to the next month?
A. No. Something has to pay for free trials and our salaries and it is a delicate balance. This may change in the future but it is easier to say no and not have to walk back on that.
Q. What is your cost per search?
A. Currently it is 1.25 cents per search. But search indexes are about to become several times more expensive and we now have the AI integration cost. We will try to keep the cost at 1.5 cents per search or below by rethinking our partnering strategy and investing more into our infrastructure.
Q. Do bangs count as searches?
A. No, bangs are free.
Q. Does immediately reloading search results, or going back from a result to rsults page count as search?
A. No, this is not counted as search.
Q. Can I subscribe again to “Early Adopter Professional” if my subscription as an early adopter cancels/expires?
A. Yes, if you were a subscriber prior to March 15, you will get the “Early Adopter” flag, and this will replace the “Professional” plan for you with “Early Adopter Professional.” It is our way of saying thank you for your support in the early days.
Q. I upgrade to Ultimate - can I later “downgrade” to “Early Adopter Professional” or will that wipe the Early Adopter status?
A. Yes, you can.
Q. If I subscribe to the annual plan before March 15, will it be unmetered for the year?
A. Yes.
Q. How do I get an annual plan?
A.
if you are already on a montly plan, go to Settings -> Billing -> Manage -> Cancel Plan (don’t worry, the money will be pro-rated)
Subscribe using the annual option in the checkout
Q. Can I see my current search usage?
A. Yes, it is available on your Billing screen. Visit this link.
Q. Does family plan includes 1,000 searches per user or total?
A. It is a shared pool across all members.
Q. Do family plan users really have to be ‘under the same roof’? (question from discord)
A. No, it was just a figure of speech. We will remove that in final design.
Q. Terrible you got rid of the free 50 searches reset monthly to only 100 total! (paraphrasing email from user)
A. Our goal was never to offer search for free. We are a paid search engine, and every free trial users’ searches have to be paid/subsidized by an actual paying user.
The change optimizes for being able to better address the needs of the actual trial users testing Kagi initially, before they make the purchasing decision.
Q. Which plan is right for me? (for math nerds)
A: If you search less than 533 times per month, the Standard plan will be cheapest. If you search more than 533, but less than 1700 times (2000 for early adopters) per month, the Professional plan is the cheapest. If you search more than 1700 times (2000 for early adopters) per month, the Ultimate plan is for you.
Q. Are you still bootstrapped?
A. Yes. We plan to do our “Familiy, Friends and Users” investment round sometime in April-May time frame. You can express interest by signing up here."

"3form Flek Pure Is a 100% Recycled Material That Remains Translucent
The following post is brought to you by 3form. Our partners are hand-picked by the Design Milk team because they represent the best in design.
Just because a product exists doesn’t mean you should stop trying to improve upon it. Such is the case with 3form’s Flek Pure, a 100 percent recycled material primarily sourced from 3form’s own in-house waste. Flek originally made its debut in 2019 using roughly 75 percent recycled material. Now, Flek Pure achieves 3form’s long-term goal of maximizing the amount of repurposed material used while also maintaining its translucency, unlike most recycled products on the market.
“The most exciting part of the design process was our motivation to keep innovating,” says 3form’s product development team, who spent the better part of a decade bringing Flek Pure to life. “We didn’t stop when the Flek Collection first launched because we knew we wouldn’t be satisfied until we reached 100 percent recycled material. This was a challenging, extensive process, but the result is so rewarding.”
During the manufacturing process of Flek Pure panels, internally sourced edge trimmings, returned samples, and reclaimed materials of 3form’s signature Varia resin are upcycled. These remnants are encapsulated and the pellets are carefully sorted by 3form’s optical sorter for clarity and cleanliness. The final product is a texturized, terrazzo-like material that’s sustainable and durable, as well as full of depth that allows for beautiful shadow play.
After Flek’s introduction in 2019, 3form wanted to upgrade the production process of the panels to further reflect the sustainable end product. The product development team sourced new materials and updated the supply chain, increasing Flek’s recycled content from 71 percent to 100 percent for Flek Pure applications.
From process to product, these sustainability achievements are a culmination of 3form’s nearly 20-year commitment to Align, a program of earth- and people-centric initiatives focused on three main pillars: people, product, and planet. Align effectively re-doubles 3form’s efforts to pursue environmentally and socially responsible design. Extending to all members of the 3form family, they strive to develop materials with intentionality that will empower architects, designers, and consumers to make smart choices about how they buy and build. By creating a closed-loop product, like Flek Pure, 3form raises their internal standard for future products and contributes to the restoration of our planet and the betterment of human lives. Align is the next step toward net-positive manufacturing within all 3form companies.
As architects and designers strive for higher sustainability standards in the materials they use, Flek Pure delivers closed-loop solutions to privacy partitions, room dividers, accent pieces, exterior walls, and more. Professionals can also contribute to 3form’s waste reduction. When designers order any of 3form’s Varia materials or return product samples to 3form’s Salt Lake City headquarters (using prepaid shipping labels), the materials are pelletized to be used for Flek.
Flek is part of 3form’s Varia product platform, which carries a Greenguard Gold Certification, is Declare Red List Free, and has an Optimized Environmental Product Declaration label. Flek is available in 4’x8’ and 4’x10’ panels, with 1/4″, 3/8″, and 1/2″ gauges, and a two-week lead time.
Flek Pure is a clear colorway made using 100 percent recycled content. The material’s translucent appearance offers the best of both worlds, allowing for natural light while maintaining separation and a level of privacy. Color can be added with Flek Bask (peachy gold), Flek Crescent (neutral taupe), and Flek Charge (electric yellow), as well as nine other colorways.

"Unilever Tries Reformulating Its Ice Cream To Survive Warmer Freezers 105
The packaged-goods giant aims to cut its environmental impact and retailers' electric bills. From a report: Unilever wants to warm up its ice cream freezers in convenience stores without turning its products into puddles, part of a broader effort to pursue green goals and potentially boost sales in the process.The consumer packaged goods giant, which sells ice cream brands including Ben & Jerry's and Magnum, is testing the performance of its products in freezers that are set to temperatures of roughly 10 degrees Fahrenheit, up from the industry standard of zero. Unilever owns most of the 3 million chest-like freezers that house its ice-cream tubs and treats in bodegas and corner stores, and the energy used to power them accounts for around 10% of Unilever's greenhouse gas footprint, according to the London-based firm. Keeping ice cream at 10 degrees as opposed to zero will reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 20% to 30% per freezer, it said.
It might also help sales with sustainability-minded consumers and even keep stores' ice-cream selling season going longer. Unilever's out-of-home ice cream sales declined slightly during the fourth quarter of 2022 because, the company said, some stores unplugged their freezers sooner in the year than usual. ""What was happening was that shopkeepers in some markets responded to fears about rising energy costs by switching off their cabinets earlier than they otherwise would have done,"" departing Chief Executive Alan Jope said in discussing the results earlier this month. Unilever in January said Hein Schumacher would take over as CEO in July. [...] But the strategy has required Unilever to reformulate some of its ice creams so they can withstand higher temperatures without melting, losing structural integrity or forfeiting what the company calls their distinctive mouthfeel. Higher temperatures can lead to softer ice creams that stick to wrappers and slide off ice cream sticks, for example, said Andrew Sztehlo, chief research and development officer for Unilever's ice cream division. Other ingredients such as wafer cones can turn soggy in warmer temperatures, he said.

"Our unhealthy practices and way of living are truly harmful to the environment and have been slowly leading to its deterioration. And the world has been changing (for the worse) because of this. Hence, it is extremely important to live sustainably and consciously and to take care of the environment in 2023! Integrating sustainability into our day-to-day lives has become crucial. And we can do this in various ways. Designers and creators are coming up with sustainable alternatives for almost everything. Every product that is necessary and utilized by us in our everyday routine has an eco-friendly alternative to it. Replacing our usual mass-produced designs with these greener options will make a huge difference to the environment and Mother Earth. From a Saturn-inspired sustainable lamp to a bicycle seat made from cork– we’ve curated a whole collection of sustainable product designs to help you go green.
1. 3D-printed Seats
Designed by Johannes Steinbauer Office For Design, these 3D-printed chairs are produced using additive manufacturing and are created without using fabrics, springs, and foam! And they still manage to be super functional and comfortable. These chairs utilize rigid parts, instead of the typical racks from chairs.
Why is it noteworthy?
The design is simple enough with four legs, a round seat, and a single bar at the back. But if you want to add other components like more racks or even textiles, these can also be added through 3D printing. The different parts are easy to assemble and disassemble and once it reaches the end of life, you can dispose of the different parts separately and recycle them accordingly.
What we like
- Super easy to assemble and disassemble
- Sustainable design
What we dislike
- No instruction on having a space-saving version of this design
2. Vis-à-vis and Rendez-vous
I’ve realized that filling up your bathroom with thoughtful designs, only makes your time in it much more comfortable and smooth. And this collection of bathroom seating by Italian bathroom brand Agape strives to be exactly that! Designed by Marco Carini for Agape, the collection includes two seating designs created from recycled cork.
Why is it noteworthy?
The first design is called Vis-à-vis, and it is a light and sturdy stool that also doubles up as a tiny side table. The second design is Rendez-vous, and it’s a bench that serves as an extensive seating option for bathroom users. Both designs function as comfortable spots to sit and relax in the bathroom.
What we like
- Crafted from recycled cork
- The curving form resembles someone smiling
What we dislike
- Not suited for bathrooms with a smaller footprint
3. The SATURNO Lamp
Of all the planets in our neighborhood, Saturn has always mesmerized our minds with its beautiful rings, and it has probably served as the muse for many lamp designs. This somewhat spherical lamp, for example, borrows some ideas from the planet’s morphology to create something unique, fun, striking, and sustainable, all at the same time.
Why is it noteworthy?
The SATURNO lamp is actually made of three disc-shaped parts that connect without the use of any glue or screws. There are cutouts instead that allow the parts to be inserted into each other at perpendicular angles. Two are made from walnut wood, while the third is made from resin, which could be any sustainable kind.
What we like
- SATURNO’s LEDs can be controlled to show different colors and different intensities
- A versatile lighting fixture that gives a glimpse of the heavens right inside your home
What we dislike
- The lamp won’t stand with its horizontal light mimicking the light scattered by Saturn’s rings unless it is provided with some support
4. Plantd
Based in North Carolina, the firm Plantd Materials has produced a new material ‘Plantd’. Built using processed perennial grass, the material is said to be lighter and stronger as compared to traditional timber boards, but will capture more carbon.
Why is it noteworthy?
The firm says that the material is a “blend of fast-growing perennial grasses”, that they hope will be used as an alternative to traditional oriented strand board (OBS). OBS is a material similar to plywood that is used to sheath floors and walls.
What we like
- An eco-friendly alternative to OBS
- Stronger and lighter than timber
What we dislike
- The production of the material hasn’t started yet
5. The Kreis Cup
Meet the Kreis Cup, a coffee cup that’s sustainable, durable, and designed to enhance your coffee-drinking experience! Available in cup and travel-mug styles, the Kreis Cup is a reusable cup made from used coffee grounds and plant-based materials, free of petroleum-based plastics.
Why is it noteworthy?
It is heat resistant and designed to keep your coffee hot longer. That being said, the Kreis Cup is still ultimately biodegradable, unlike the plastic-based to-go mugs you get at your local cafe or the breakable ceramic mugs you use at home. Once it reaches the end of its lifespan, the Kreis Cup disintegrates easily into the soil, leaving absolutely nothing behind.
What we like
- Made from spent coffee grounds that have been dried, treated, and then suspended in a natural, plant-based polymer
- Has the faint, unmistakable scent of coffee
What we dislike
- You can’t use the Kreis to drink tea, juice, or anything else, given the lingering smell of coffee that comes from these cups
6. USB-C AirPods Pro
Ken Pillonel, the engineer and YouTuber behind the world’s first USB-C iPhone and AirPods, just revealed upgrades for the AirPods Pro. His custom build features a new 3D printed case that can be opened and repaired (thanks to screws on the back), along with a USB-C connector on the base instead of the conventional Lightning port. Pillonel’s build isn’t just a one-off custom project, though. He’s made his project open-source and available to the public, allowing pretty much anyone to upgrade their own AirPods Pro
Why is it noteworthy?
With this project, Pillonel’s taking matters into his own hands by actually selling the charging module on his website for people to buy. You can even find schematics for 3D printing your own AirPods case, on the off-chance that you happen to break yours while prying it open.
What we like
It’s easy to open if you ever need to replace the battery on the inside
What we dislike
- You will have to 3D-print your own module which could be inconvenient for some
7. Rootfull
At the 2022 London Design Festival, Zena Holloway presented an intriguing collection of sculptures, products, and wearables grown completely from grass root! Called, ‘Rootfull’, the collection was presented at the inaugural edition of the ‘Materials Matter’ design fair.
Why is it noteworthy?
The collection includes a dress with a collar piece, other coral-inspired sculptural pieces, substantial wall hangings, and root-grown lamps with interesting coral textures. Holloway’s collection explores the possibilities and scope of root-grown textiles, and how they can be widely utilized in the future.
What we like
- Creation of a new kind of sustainable material
What we dislike
- The root-grown textiles may not be very comfy to wear
8. The Bamboo Washing Machine
It doesn’t need extra water cycles, and it runs entirely without electricity. Meet the Bamboo Washing Machine, a cleverly low-tech appliance that washes your clothes efficiently with zero wastage and emissions.
Why is it noteworthy?
A winner of the Red Dot Design Concept Award, the machine is made entirely from bamboo wood, and plugs right into a shallow riverbed, using river currents to turn the machine’s drum. The water flowing through the machine helps wash the dirt off the clothes too, giving you an entirely automated device that runs entirely on its own, using the powers of nature and human ingenuity!
What we like
- Has zero wastage and emissions
- Runs completely on its own
What we dislike
- It’s a concept!
9. FR-1 Bike Saddle
This Scottish brand is one such company that wants to bring more sustainable solutions for the bikes and bike parts that they manufacture. Their first product is called FR-1 Bike Saddle and it is made from cork
Why is it noteworthy?
At first, you would think this is not a sturdy and comfortable material for something that you will be sitting on probably for a long period. But cork is actually pretty durable and lightweight so it should be something that can last a long time and not hurt your tushy that much. It is also water-resistant and can offer better cushioning compared to other materials.
What we like
- Stronger but also more lightweight compared to the more common steel that a lot of bike seats use
- Sustainable + supports historic local cork farming
What we dislike
- It is a bit expensive
10. Zens
As a step up from the trio of charging options, Zens – a reckoned manufacturer of wireless chargers empowering freedom – has come up with a 4-in-1 Modular Wireless Charger. Designed to power an iPhone, iPad, AirPods, and Apple Watch in one go, the wireless charger is a sustainable and quick charging solution.
Why is it noteworthy?
Since an organized desk is a dream for every systematized worker, this Zens charger can go a long way in ensuring that. The idea of having all the prized Apple devices charging in one go, in one location, is not short of the peace of mind. Additionally, it leaves the desk or the nightstand organized. What more do you want? Before you go ahead and reply to that with a “Nothing”; the Zens 4-in-1 Modular Wireless Charger, with its fancy antics, comes for a $180 price tag (more on the alternative pricing options later).
What we like
- This modular charger is a convenient solution for a quick and fast charge to all your Apple devices
What we dislike
- Exorbitant price tag"

1. The Sunne Light
Dutch lighting brand Sunne partnered up with designer Marjan van Aubel to create their first product – a self-powered solar light that harvests by energy day to light up your home at night. Called, the Sunne light, the sunlight-mimicking lamp gathers solar energy and is in turn exclusively powered by it. It aims to bring the power of the sun into your home!
Why is it noteworthy?
The Sunne light has been equipped with photovoltaic cells and is meant to be hung in front of a window. The suspended lighting fixture collects solar energy through the entirety of the day, and at night it utilizes this energy to illuminate your home. It features an integrated battery that stores the solar energy it collects and hence eliminates any reliance on an external or additional power source.

What we dislike

Designed by Mpowered, the Luci Beam LED is a 2-in-1 solar-powered headlamp and flashlight, that is power-packed in a water-resistant body, allowing it to be utilized in all kinds of situations without any hassle. The product can provide up to 300 lumens of brightness, which should come in handy in so many use cases: whether you are searching for something in the store room or illuminating your pathway during a hike.
Why is it noteworthy?
Luci Beam’s ability to transform from a handheld to a headlamp is what makes it stand out from other lighting designs in the market! The 2-in-1 headlamp and flashlight is solar-powered but can also be recharged via USB if there is no sun, so you are never left stranded in the middle of an adventure.
What we like
- Features a micro-USB cable to charge on the go
- A secure headband for the headlamp and the wrist strap for the flashlight make sure that the device is always securely strapped on
What we dislike
- We’re not sure how sturdy it is to handle the rough outdoors
3. Paper-thin Solar Cell
MIT researchers created a paper-thin solar cell that is so thin and lightweight, that you can place it on almost any kind of surface! solar panels can generate 370 watts per kilogram of power, which is actually 18 times more as compared to regular solar cells.
Why is it noteworthy?
Not only does this mean that they are viable alternatives to heavy panels that burden your roof, but they can also be installed on almost any surface, including flexible ones like boat sails or tents. This paper-thin solar cell is excellent for tents, especially when they are situated in disaster-stricken areas, where power grids may not be operable at times.
What we like
- 18 times more powerful compared to conventional cells
- Can be bent or rolled like a piece of paper
What we dislike
- Missing a protective layer that will protect the cells from the environment
4. The Invisible Solar
The Invisible Solar are panels that look like these clay tiles but actually have cells underneath them that will be able to generate solar energy and power the building they are placed on.
Why is it noteworthy?
The common monocrystalline silicon cells are made from non-toxic materials and are the “invisible” part of the solar panels. Each panel is able to reach a 7.5-watt peak (peak energy capacity) and weighs around 2 kilograms each.
What we like
- The ceramic tiles look opaque but are still able to absorb the sun rays that will power the cells
- They are even self-cleaning as it has photocatalytic properties
What we dislike
- Aesthetics are unassuming
5. Ecacia
Designed by Samuel Wilkinson, Ecacia is a tree-like structure inspired by one of the species of the Acacia tree that grows in eastern and Southern Africa. This huge umbrella-like structure not only provides shade from sun and rain but can also power amenities located near it or charge electric vehicles as well.
Why is it noteworthy?
It features four programmable LED lamps that give off light to the surrounding areas at the night. Prototypes in the future will also be amped with a cooling mist function so that the public areas can be cooled down during the warm season. The umbrellas will provide a temporary respite to passersby.
What we like
- Features 708 monocrystalline solar panels to capture solar energy
What we dislike
- It’s still in the prototype stage!
6. The Tesla Solar Range Extending Trailer
Tesla quietly launched one of its innovations at IdeenExpo in Hannover German. The EV giant unveiled a prototype of yet another product they’re working on – a trailer that attaches to the back of your EV and has been amped with fold-out solar panels and battery packs that help expand your EV’s range.
Why is it noteworthy?
Called, the Tesla Solar Range Extending trailer, the electric vehicle is quite simply put – massive. It’s as big as the other large trailers on the market, and it boasts fold-out solar panels that charge a pretty large battery pack placed below it. This battery pack can be used as an additional power source for the EV.
What we like
- Features a SpaceX Starlink internet terminal
- Amped with solar panels
What we dislike
- We don’t know if or when it will be launched
7. The Parelio
The Parelio looks like a super fun design, and it is! It is a solar-powered beach umbrella that is able to harness the power of the sun to create sustainable energy. The accessory is ideal for both lawns and beaches, and it can absorb sunlight, and convert it into electricity that can be used to power phone chargers, coolers, mini-fridges, and machinery as well!
Why is it noteworthy?
Instead of the usual beach umbrella design that folds down towards the earth, this one folds upward towards the sun as it absorbs its energy. The inspiration for the design is a combination of origami and the solar systems on NASA spacecraft.
What we like
- Amped with foldable photovoltaic panels
- Folds upwards towards the sun, rather than towards the earth
What we dislike
- It’s still a concept!
8. The Solgaard Solarbank Boombox
Choosing a decent Bluetooth speaker is always a task, but now sustainability has been added to the mix as well! Your tech needs to be more eco-friendly as well now. The aim now is to make “greener” choices for the future of the planet. For this reason, the new Solgaard Solarbank Boombox portable speaker enters the market with a sustainable design.
Why is it noteworthy?
The upcycled plastic design refers to speaker cloth and outer shell from plastic waste. These are waste materials but had been upcycled and used instead. This process is part of the brand’s initiative to pull about 5 lbs of plastic for every product sold.
What we like
- The Solgaard Solarbank Boombox lets you enjoy music while the battery harnesses the power of the sun
- It is sand-proof, water-proof, and drop-proof
What we dislike
- The speaker’s looks are unimpressive and quite common
9. Stil
Humans need water to survive, however, and people in remote parts of the world are forced to drink unclean, bacteria-laden water just to live, only to get sick from the same. Deploying water purifiers to these locations might sound like the simplest solution, but most of these require electricity which is also difficult to come by, even with solar generators. This concept, however, harnesses the power of the sun in a different way and offers a solution that is sustainable through and through.
Why is it noteworthy?
Stil, in contrast, uses solar energy, not to power electronics but to clean the water almost directly. It uses the age-old method of heating up water to boiling point and then collecting the condensation as clean, distilled water.
What we like
- Can be positioned and used anywhere
What we dislike
- No complaints!
10. The Matte Works Solar Watches
In today’s day and age, the world of smartwatches is run over by those with disposable lithium-ion batteries and planned obsolescence life cycles, the Matte Works solar watches are literally quite a refreshing change! These minimal and clean watches feature an evergreen aesthetic, that quite smartly conceals the solar panels placed below the watch dial.
Why is it noteworthy?
Unlike a smartwatch that ends up becoming ‘old news’ after the company launches its next version a year later, the Matte Works solar watches stay classy and functional for years, while underscoring the importance of relying on renewable energy.
What we like
- The watch comes with a classic aesthetic that conceals its powerful feature underneath a tinted dial
What we dislike
- Aesthetically looks quite similar to other watches on the market"
"- Tesla stock ""gets boring,"" Bespoke Investment Group said after the EV maker's update.
- Wall Street's expectations for Tesla look more like those for a traditional carmaker and less like a disruptor, it said.
- Bespoke spotted the highest correlation between Tesla stock and other automakers since 2016.
""Tesla Gets Boring.""
That was the determination of Bespoke Investment Group on Thursday as Wall Street analysts drilled down on the mechanics of Tesla's $10 trillion plan to foster global sustainability while ramping up sales of electric vehicles.
Tesla stock fell as much as 8% to a one-month low on Thursday as investors appeared to be let down by a lack of details from CEO Elon Musk about new EV models.
Instead, the company's ""Master Plan Part 3"" presentation on Wednesday revealed a factory is coming to Mexico and that Tesla is working on halving production costs to sell 20 million electric vehicles a year by 2030.
""With investors and analyst coverage focused on more concrete metrics and timelines, expectations for TSLA are being pushed to behave more like a traditional [original equipment manufacturer] and less like a disruptor,"" Bespoke wrote.
""On average, the rolling 1-year correlation of daily percentage changes for TSLA compared to other major OEM stocks like Ford, General Motors, Stellantis and Toyota has risen to the highest levels since at least 2016,"" it said.
""In other words, the market is treating TSLA more and more like just another automaker.""
Despite the latest sell-off, Tesla stock is still up more than 50% so far this year, while GM is up 16% and Ford is up 6%.
Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, in a note Thursday said retail investors owned about 41% of Tesla as of December while Musk held 14% or 446 million shares.
""Musk is a wild character; it's a very volatile stock largely due to him,"" he said, pointing to last year's 60% price plunge in part as Musk sold shares of the EV maker to fund his Twitter takeover.
About Tesla's update: ""Some key takeaways, in general, are that [Tesla is] still in the rapid growth phase, in our opinion,"" Mahoney said."
"- Former Ford CEO Mark Fields saw Tesla's investor day as reaffirming the automaker's reign over the EV industry.
- Though the event lacked details on new models, it demonstrated the company's leadership in key areas, he told CNBC.
- ""Tesla still has the leg-up on the competition, and I think they demonstrated that yesterday.""
While Tesla stock sold off after its investor day failed to provide details on new EV models, former Ford CEO Mark Fields heard enough to remain confident in the company's future.
In particular, Wednesday's event was more like a conventional investor day and mostly lacked CEO Elon Musk's usual grandiose claims, he said in a CNBC interview on Thursday, though he's less sure of its goal to sell 20 million vehicles by 2030.
The company also showcased other executives, which could alleviate concern that Musk has been too distracted by his other business ventures. They also talked about ""meat and potato"" topics like cutting costs, improving margins, and EV-charging infrastructure.
The keys to winning the EV race will come down to product appeal, software or user interface, controlling cost, and consistent execution, he said.
""And Tesla right now is one generation ahead of the other automakers,"" Fields said, though rivals like Ford and Hyundai are making a lot of progress. ""Tesla still has the leg-up on the competition, and I think they demonstrated that yesterday.""
Tesla stock tumbled around 7% after Wednesday's presentation disappointed investors by not confirming any new car models. Instead, Musk's much-awaited ""Master Plan 3"" mainly established goals for Tesla to expand its role in achieving global sustainability.
Amid the things laid out on Wednesday was the firm's commitment to sell 20 million cars a year by 2030 and confirmation of a new Gigafactory in Mexico, potentially allowing the automaker to create vehicles at under $30,000.
However, Fields predicted that the EV industry will eventually have no one leader as the market continues to strengthen.
""There's going to be a number of winners and there's going to be a number of losers because, when you look at the adoption of EVs over time, I mean, this is a huge addressable market,"" he said."
"Today’s smartphones are beautiful pieces of technology, but their power and appearance come at more than just a literal price. To ensure their durability and secrecy, they are closed shut to ward off people trying to pry them open, even if those people are just trying to repair the phone. Those old enough to have seen the early days of mobile phones might fondly remember handsets like those from Nokia that let you easily swap a dead battery for a fully charged one. The original Nokia has long stepped away from this industry, but HMD Global has resurrected not only the brand but also some of its most iconic models. Its latest trick now is to also revive what made the old Nokia phones, specifically with a new Nokia G22 that is meant to be easily repaired, unlike most other phones today.
Designer: HMD Global
Smartphones have gotten a lot more complicated these days, so it’s not exactly surprising that they wouldn’t be easy to fix. At the same time, however, the industry has made it too expensive and restrictive to get these devices repaired by authorized service providers that some people are willing to take the risk with third-party shops. Phone makers have also been very careful in protecting their image and intellectual properties that they penalize even well-meaning people who just want to prolong their phone’s life.
Although things seem to have slowed down a bit, that status quo has slowly started to change for the better, with smartphone makers easing up on those repair restrictions. Unsurprisingly, the bigger brands like Apple and Samsung are still extremely cautious, but HMD Global is making a huge leap instead. The new Nokia G22, for example, was designed right from the start to be easy to open and repair, and the manufacturer even partnered with repair expert iFixit to sell replacement parts and provide guides.
Of course, not every part of the phone is repairable, with only the back cover, battery, screen, and charging port provided with replacements. Using a plastic guitar pick and a screwdriver, however, is exponentially easier than heating the phone’s back to loosen adhesives. The battery can also be pulled out with some effort but without having to use some alcohol to also loosen the glue. Replacement parts will be available for five years, potentially making the Nokia G22 the company’s longest-lasting phone.
The catch is that, in terms of hardware, the Nokia G22 isn’t exactly noteworthy, except for its large 5,050mAh battery. Replacing the battery still involves a bit of work, but HMD Global says that the alternative would be to have a smaller battery and a thicker phone. We’re still far, far away from having a premium flagship be this easy to repair, and it’s doubtful we’ll reach that point. Thankfully, some, like the Fairphone and this new Nokia G22, are offering alternatives to those who care more about the environment than having the latest and flashiest model every year or so."
"Thankfully, not all the impacts of Covid-19 were bad. The overnight enforcement of work-from-home accelerated digital adoption plans by a few years. Now that the worst of the pandemic is behind us, enterprises are enthusiastic, and also better positioned, to move ahead. And one way many are moving is to the cloud.
For many organizations, innovation is the first step forward. Recently, when 800 executives from the Asia Pacific region, the UK and North America were surveyed, 89% said they were under pressure to innovate to overcome disruption and uncertainty in their industry. Interestingly, this applied even to sectors such as infrastructure, construction and transportation, which have been slow to modernize.
For organizations that want to advance, there is only one environment for innovation, and that is the cloud. Enterprises that are not quite there should therefore start with cloud transformation as preparation for next-generation innovation.
However, many organizations assume, wrongly, that this simply calls for lifting on-premise infrastructure and shifting it to the public cloud. They should understand that to extract the full value of the cloud, and create a solid foundation for innovation, they must center their cloud transformations on the following:
1. Data and analytics
Data is the lifeblood of innovation, and there’s no stemming the flow: A survey published in January 2022 revealed that in North American enterprises with more than 1,000 employees, the average monthly rate of growth in data volume was a staggering 63%, and the average number of data sources was 400. It is absolutely unviable to manage information of this size and complexity with on-premise infrastructure. This is why more than 99% of respondents said they would migrate their data to the cloud within two years.
Cloud offers not just unlimited storage and compute, but also a wealth of analytics, machine learning and AI solutions as a service, so enterprises can extract accurate, actionable and real-time insights.
A clear use case for cloud, data and analytics that will resonate with most enterprises is supply chain improvement.
Supply chain disruption, which started during the pandemic in 2020, and extended with the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, continues to challenge businesses in 2023. However, they can mitigate the impact by improving end-to-end supply chain visibility and leveraging that visibility (read data) for supply chain modeling, strategic planning, and risk and reliability assessments, using solutions off the cloud.
Toyota is a great example of how to use the cloud’s analytical power to strengthen the supply chain. In North America, the company’s aging on-premise vehicle data warehouse (VDW) was struggling to handle rising data volumes. By modernizing the VDW with a next-generation data lake on public cloud, the company was able to reduce complexity, eliminate data duplication, raise data quality and create a foundation for sophisticated analytics.
2. Security in the cloud
According to one estimate, 60% of corporate data is already in the cloud. Thus, cloud security is a huge priority for the leadership in data-driven organizations. The good news is that hyperscalers have made huge strides in securing their environments. Still, enterprises need to take certain steps to secure their cloud transformation.
The first is to shift from network-centric to user-centric security. This is because when users access cloud data from anywhere, traditional network perimeter security becomes irrelevant. Instead, the need is to secure information and applications where they are — in the cloud — using zero-trust architecture.
Next, organizations need to reconfigure systems and applications for the cloud. Misconfiguration is almost always the underlying cause of a cloud breach. Today, new models and architectures protect cloud-based workloads.
A proven method is to treat security as “code.” Security as code (SaC) automates the enforcement of security policies and standards. So, if company policy says a certain data category must be encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud, any code that fails to do this is automatically rejected.
Another advantage of SaC is that testing is integrated within a continuous Integration and delivery process so vulnerabilities can be found and fixed quickly. It also enables security teams to work at cloud speed, and embed security within workloads to minimize risk. In effect, SaC allows enterprises to innovate freely and rapidly by providing them a safe cloud environment.
3. Sustainability
If climate change were not reason enough, soaring bills are driving enterprises to search for ways to lower energy consumption.
Scaling back energy-guzzling data centers is definitely one of them. Migrating workloads from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud can cut energy usage dramatically because cloud providers use their capacity much more efficiently: A cloud server can handle 100 times the workload that an on-premise server of similar size can. In addition, hyperscalers are further improving the sustainability of their clouds. Together, these measures can help enterprises shrink their carbon footprints significantly.
Indeed, organizations should use the full potential of the cloud for improving sustainability. For example, they can migrate their workloads to the cloud of a provider that helps them retire their old servers and hardware in a sustainable manner. Amazon, Cisco, Dell and Google are all part of the Circular Electronics Partnership (CEP), which promotes the reuse and recycling of technology infrastructure.
The cloud can also streamline highly complicated ESG reporting by standardizing data and automating reporting processes. At least one hyperscaler has a cloud-based SaaS offering for reporting carbon emissions and monitoring progress against reduction targets. An encouraging sign is that many leading corporations are using the cloud to support their ESG agendas.
4. Connectivity
Today’s enterprises are global entities, with operations distributed all over the world. And with the hybrid work model taking hold, the workforce in most organizations is untethered from the office. Consequently, software applications, equipment sensors, supplier networks, customers and employees need to access company systems from just about anywhere.
When embarking on cloud transformation, organizations should ensure their providers can deliver the connectivity, integrations and compute required by their highly dispersed operations.
5. Scalability
Often, in order to experiment with new ideas, enterprises need to create large computing capacities. This capacity goes unutilized once the project is complete. Even if that weren’t the case, enterprises may find it challenging to expand capacity amid the enduring chip shortage. One way to avoid waiting for hardware is to tap the cloud’s vast infrastructure.
With its near-unlimited flexibility, the cloud allows innovators to scale compute and storage up and down on demand. Cloud also supports innovation in other ways. For example, entrusting infrastructure hosting and provisioning to a cloud service provider frees up time that an enterprise could then devote to innovation.
The emergence of multicloud/polycloud, and consequent dismantling of vendor lock-in, bring unprecedented agility to provisioning, which is critical for “fail fast” innovation.
Summing up
The cloud can save enterprises time and money. However, cloud transformation is incomplete until it changes them into highly innovative organizations — effectively, into next-gen digital businesses.
To create such an environment of unlimited innovation, it is important to factor in five priorities in cloud transformation: data and analytics; security; sustainability; connectivity; and scalability.
Besides powering innovation, the cloud can also help organizations overcome the pressing challenges of 2023, including supply chain disruption, energy costs and a chip shortage that’s affecting everything from hardware purchases to business continuity.

"Tiny homes gained popularity a couple of years ago, and since then they’ve cemented their place in the world of architecture. What started off as a cute little trend is now turning into a serious option for home spaces. You could say that 2022 was the year of tiny homes! And I do believe this will continue well in the future. They are a space-saving and eco-friendly living solution that reduces the load on Mother Earth. They’re simple and minimal alternatives to the imposing and materialistic homes that seem to have taken over. And if you love exploring tiny homes, as much as I do, then you’ve reached the right spot. We’ve curated an eclectic and exciting range of micro homes that will totally satisfy your love for tiny homes! From a 40′ highly insulated converted shipping container tiny home with a pocket-friendly price tag to a picturesque tiny home perched idyllically on a slope with views of the sea – there’s a tiny home here for everyone!
1. Coodo
A couple of years ago, German entrepreneur Mark Dare Schmiedel got pretty fed up with the chaos of Berlin and decided to move to the countryside, building his own quaint loft along the banks of the River Spree. The peace, calm, and zen that followed, got him wondering whether it would be possible to create a similar, but a mobile form of home, that could provide the same sanctuary to others. In his quest for such a retreat, he came across a mobile home concept designed by a group of Slovenian architects called ‘Coodo’. Schmiedel went on to procure the design rights of the concept, through his company LTG Lofts to Go and kickstarted the production of the units. The modular homes aim to bring you closer to nature, to a space away from the crowds, where you can truly enjoy the beauty of a moment.
Why is it noteworthy?
It features a curved and minimal steel frame with rounded edges and stunning floor-to-ceiling glass walls. The beautiful glass walls allow a generous stream of sunlight to enter the home. Whether on rooftops in the city, on beaches, on mountains or alongside a river, the Coodo can be easily installed almost anywhere.
What we like
- Integrated utilization of smart home technology
- Adherence to Passive House standards

7. Common Knowledge x Tigín Tiny Homes
Irish social enterprise Common Knowledge has collaborated with Tigín Tiny Homes to create low-carbon micro homes that are meant to provide sustainable and economical housing solutions to people struggling to buy their own homes. Currently, property prices in Ireland are increasing by 11 percent every year, and this project hopes to tackle this ongoing housing crisis, and “empower people to take action on the housing and climate crises.”
Why is it noteworthy?
Besides building these sustainable and affordable dwellings, they are also providing training schemes to teach residents how to build and repair their own homes! The founder of Common Knowledge, Fionn Kidney said, “Ultimately, the plan of our Tigín project is not just to build these Tiny Homes, but to teach more than two hundred people with the skills to build these or any other projects themselves, whilst creating and releasing a free-to-use blueprint at the end of this year.”

- The twenty-square-foot homes feature a facade of corrugated hemp panels, cork insulation, and natural rubber flooring
- The homes are spread out across two levels, giving them a spacious feel, although they are compactly sized
What we dislike
- Not the most aesthetically pleasing homes
8. Buster
Buster is located in Matamata, just a couple of hours away from Auckland, New Zealand. You will be able to hear the sound of spring river water flowing around you as you’re surrounded by trees, stones, valleys, and basically the joys of nature. It’s located below the Kaimai Range “amongst ancient native bush and farmland”. It is a tiny home perfect for one person or a couple who wants to temporarily or even permanently live in such an area and to have something that is built sustainably and with the environment and your comfort in mind.
Why is it noteworthy?
Instead of being made from timber, it uses black corrugate as it will last longer and can survive all the different kinds of weather that the area experiences. They also used plywood to bring “a sense of warmth” to the house and is in fact what is also used in the traditional kiwi trampers huts, giving you even more of a local feel but with modern conveniences. It’s a pretty good combination, having a more natural lodging but using sustainable technology and devices to give you comfort and function.
What we like
- Buster is powered by GridFree solar panels
- The house is oriented to the north so that it will be able to maximize the light during the summer and even during the winter
What we dislike
- The solar energy is only enough to power a small fridge, and lights, and to charge your smartphones
9. The Slope House
The Slope House from the 3D visualizer Milad Eshtiyaghi is an untraditional A-frame cabin that employs a biophilic design inside and out. 3D visualizer and international architect Milad Eshtiyaghi has long been drawn to escapist hideaways perched on rugged, seaside cliffs and isolated cabins envisioned beneath the Northern Lights. Today, he turns his gaze to tiny cabins. A bit more quaint than treacherous, Eshtiyaghi’s latest 3D visualization finds an angular, timber cabin nestled atop an idyllic hillside somewhere in the rainforests of Brazil.
Why is it noteworthy?
Dubbed the Slope House, the timber cabin maintains a signature triangular frame that’s a thoughtful twist on the conventional A-frame cabin. Defined by two modules, one internal volume hosts the cabin’s bedroom while the other keeps the home’s main living spaces, like the dining area, kitchen, and den. The tiny cabin from Eshtiyaghi is envisioned propped atop a truss system that was specifically chosen to minimize the home’s impact on the preexisting landscape.
What we like
- A biophilic design style has been integrated into the cabin’s interior spaces
- Natural plants have been added inside the house as a small garden
What we dislike
- The theme and form of the home may be a bit too eccentric for some
10. MiniMod
Nestled in the redwood forest of the popular and beautiful Sea Ranch community along the Sonoma, California coastline is a 684-square-foot weekend cabin that was originally designed by the acclaimed Bay Area architect Joseph Esherick. Called MiniMod, this cabin was lovingly restored and refurbished by Framestudio after it was purchased by its creative director Chad DeWitt, and his husband James Cook.
Why is it noteworthy?
The cabin was originally built to show how a comfortable and affordable home could be constructed while following the Sea Ranch building guidelines. The midcentury modern cabin has a stunning wooden exterior that allows it to effortlessly blend with the surrounding natural environment
What we like
- Midcentury aesthetics but modern amenities
- The history and heritage of the cabin have been maintained
What we dislike
- They don’t offer unique wood finishes/materials to approach ones individuality"
"The Welsh Rugby Union and the Welsh regions have said there is “no room for manoeuvre” on the budget for player contracts in Wales despite the threat of strike action putting next week’s Six Nations fixture against England in jeopardy.
Nigel Walker, the WRU’s interim chief executive, met with senior Wales players on Wednesday in an attempt to soothe relations after it emerged strike action was being considered over the contract renewals, with a meeting soon to take place between the Welsh Rugby Players Association and players.
Having accepted pay cuts of 20% during the Covid period, players in Wales are now faced with further cuts under the proposed six-year deal between the WRU and the regions. The take-or-leave-it deal which has to be signed by 28 February – three days after the England game – would see lower wages all round and bonuses introduced into contracts for the first time.
However, the Professional Rugby Board, the body which consists of representatives of the four regions plus the WRU, said the new deal was necessary to bring sustainability to the sport.
“The new agreement offers a complete funding package to the professional game in Wales, but it does come with financial limitations which will directly affect salary negotiations,” said the PRB chair, Malcolm Wall, in a statement on Wednesday evening. “The cold facts are that the WRU and clubs have been paying salaries that their businesses cannot afford, so the new agreement establishes a new framework for contract negotiations.
“There is a stipulation that all current contracts will be honoured, but these businesses must return to a sustainable footing in order for the success we all crave to follow.
“The average salary of a Welsh professional rugby player under the new framework will be around £100k per year. We are confident that our salary packages are in line with the UK market. The PRB accepts that some better-funded English and French clubs are paying more, but this is where we must set the mark of sustainability in Wales.”
The PRB’s statement added that there was “no room for manoeuvre when it comes to the overall budget available for player contracts”. Walker said: “We know we are not in an ideal situation, but it is incredibly important for the whole game in Wales for us to get this next step right.”
Meanwhile, the Ospreys lock and former Wales international Bradley Davies has urged the PRB to listen to players’ concerns over the future of rugby in the country and to make the changes necessary to avoid a strike.
Davies, a second-row capped 66 times by his country and still in action for the Ospreys at the age of 36, said strike action is the “last option” for players and that a lack of representation at the top of the game in Wales is as big a frustration for players across the four regional teams as proposals for another pay cut.
“We choose to be rugby players. We aren’t asking for more money, we are just asking for a voice in the way things are run – player welfare, how many games you play, head injury stuff, mental health,” he said. “As players we have zero input into all that at the moment. All the boys want is a bit of communication.
“Let’s all get around a table, let’s speak, let’s make Welsh rugby good again. We are not far off it. If we had to strike, and that was the decision everyone made, then fair enough – but it’s the last, last option.”
While players have been offered verbal commitments from their regions, nothing can be firmed up until the new deal is signed. Some players have already left, many others are considering moves to England and abroad and, at a more basic level, many others are concerned for their financial futures.
“The WRPA has improved 10-fold since I first became a member and the people involved now are outstanding,” said Davies. “But we’re still not where we need to be. We haven’t got representation on the PRB and can’t put the players’ point of view across.
“During Covid, we accepted all the pay cuts, we didn’t argue one bit. We just accepted everything that was chucked at us. All we wanted was a voice and a seat on the board, and that was stopped. Yet we’re expected to rock up for work, run into a brick wall, take our money and then get up Monday and go again. All the boys are asking for is a bit of a say in their own destiny.”"
"When the hydrogen-powered Hyundai Nexo car was launched in the UK in the spring of 2019, it was described as “so beautifully clean” that it “purifies the air as it goes”.
Hyundai Motor UK claimed that if 10,000 of its cars were on the road, carbon emission reduction would be “equivalent to planting 60,000 trees”.
The suggestion that the new car – with a starting price of about £60,000 – could be driven without leaving any pollution sounded almost too good to be true, and in June 2021 the advertising regulator ruled that it was.
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found that while the car does filter incoming air, it still releases pollutants from tyre and brake wear, with road tyres being a huge source of toxic particle pollution. Hyundai considered it had corroborated its claims, making clear it did not intend to suggest the vehicle left no particulates in the air, but the ASA ruled the ad was misleading and should not be used again.
Green claims routinely used to sell products, from cars and plane tickets to soft drinks and cleaning fluids, now face much greater scrutiny under proposed new laws – and risk fines of up to tens of millions of pounds for claims found to be unsubstantiated and misleading.
Under the digital markets, competition and consumer bill to be unveiled shortly, big companies face the threat of civil penalties of up to 10% of global turnover for breaches of consumer law. Individuals who breach these laws will face fines of up to £300,000. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said passing the new bill is a priority for the government.
Lawyers said last week that new powers for the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to impose direct civil penalties on companies will almost certainly cover misleading environmental claims, known as greenwashing.
Richard Reichman, a specialist in regulatory investigations and enforcement at BCL Solicitors, said: “Greenwashing is in the crosshairs of the regulators, and I think we will almost certainly see large fines against corporations if they ignore the warnings.”
Stuart Ponting, a partner in regulatory and compliance at the legal firm Walker Morris, said: “The CMA is limited in consumer protection matters and this will widen their powers. It’s a bigger stick and they will be more willing to use it if necessary.”
The CMA published a green claims code in September 2021 and announced last July that it was investigating the eco-friendly and sustainability claims of three brands: Asos, Boohoo and George at Asda. The regulator said it would examine whether claims were misleading but has not reached a view on whether there have been breaches of consumer law.
The CMA announced last month that it would also examine the accuracy of environmental claims made about household essentials such as food, drink and toiletries.
In August last year, an advert for Persil, a brand owned by Unilever, was banned by the ASA after it ruled that the basis for the claim of “kinder to our planet” had not been made clear. Unilever said last week that it had led the way with environmental improvements, and was surprised by the ASA ruling because the advert had been cleared for broadcasting.
The Financial Conduct Authority has consulted on its own package of measures aimed at “clamping down on greenwashing”. It proposes restrictions on how certain terms such as “green” or “sustainable” can be used in investment product names and for marketing.
The European Union is also to table a new law in the next few weeks proposing fines for companies making unsubstantiated environmental claims. France introduced laws in January requiring firms claiming a product is carbon-neutral to report on all the greenhouse emissions of that product for its entire lifecycle.
George Harding-Rolls, campaign manager at the sustainability organisation Changing Markets Foundation, said companies had not previously been properly tested on their green claims and they should be required to provide all relevant evidence to back up any of their assertions.
He said: “It’s easy money to make by saying: ‘If you buy these products, then you can make a difference.’ Many of these claims are misleading and are not supported by evidence.”
Any serious offences of greenwashing would be breaches of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Under the proposed laws to be unveiled shortly, the CMA will be able to impose civil monetary penalties for breaches of “core” consumer laws.
Hyundai did not respond last week to a request by the Observer to support the claim of the impact on carbon emissions of putting 10,000 Nexo cars on the road, but said the claim on its website had been removed.
Hyundai said in response to the June 2021 ruling: “Our own internal tests and the fundamental mechanics of the air purification system contained within the hydrogen fuel cell system of the Nexo corroborated relevant claims used in regard to Nexo.”
Officials say details of the new bill will be announced shortly."
"When Nick Seagrave inherited some money five years ago, he knew he wanted to do something with it that would count in the future. At the time, savings rates weren’t great and, as he and his wife had bought a house a few years earlier, he started looking at other options so the money wouldn’t just gather dust.
“I did some reading and decided to start investing,” the 36-year-old says. “Previously, I’d never really had much to save. As a graduate on a relatively low income, I didn’t have the money to spare. But all of a sudden, I had to make a decision.”
That research led him to Interactive Investor – the flat fee investment platform that gave him the opportunity to put his money into everything from self-invested personal pensions and Isas (individual savings accounts) to general trading accounts. “My decision [to use Interactive Investor] was really based on the cost of the platform,” he says. “There are so many fees everywhere, so Interactive Investor was effectively cheaper in the long term and gave me much more flexibility on investment options. I tried quite a few platforms but came back to this one.”
Seagrave started with the lump sum inheritance, and now tries to regularly “drip feed” money into his investments as part of his monthly household outgoings. He started with pensions and Isas, but his investments became more focused after the birth of their son, who’s now three. He added a Junior Isa, free with adult accounts, that he contributes to every month, and which their son will be able to access when he’s 18.
It’s been a time of change for the family. They relocated to Cornwall early last year and, after working remotely at first, Seagrave changed jobs and is now a digital marketing manager at a credit reporting company. “Apart from [the attraction of] the incredible outdoors, coastline and living on a creek, my wife is Cornish so we always planned to head back to be closer to her family. The pandemic accelerated our plans, as did our experience as parents.”
The couple’s savings were initially designed to fund an early retirement, but now have potentially an even more important role, says Seagrave. “We have some additional challenges with our son – he is autistic and access to educational support is not always forthcoming. We may need to pay for things when he’s older, so the benefits of saving are clear. Either way, it’s very much about saving for the future and saving long term.”
But putting money aside to invest isn’t as easy as it was a few years ago, says Seagrave. Since the birth of their son, they have been a one-income family: “We used to proactively put money aside at the beginning of the month when the paycheck came in. Then my wife went on maternity leave – and didn’t have a job to go back to after the pandemic, so there’s less money to put away. But it’s not knocked us off track.”
While other household spending may be restricted, Seagrave has managed to carry on investing – albeit on a smaller scale. “We can pay the mortgage and bills but there’s not a huge amount of wriggle room. We haven’t really had many holidays in the past couple of years. But we’re still saving, not the amount we were five years ago, but we’re managing.”
Seagrave remains optimistic. “I think we are in a better position than many,” he says. “Our bank balance is either positive or neutral at the end of the month.”
When it comes to his investments, Seagrave describes himself as relatively hands on. “I wouldn’t call myself an expert, I have read up and I’m confident. I like to choose sustainable investments – I think it’s important as a consumer to try to make sure that most decisions are made with sustainability in mind and to know what your money is doing.”
Although Seagrave feels confident about his knowledge, the language around investing can be off-putting, he says. “There’s a lot of jargon and I feel like it’s deliberately complicated by the industry, whereas actually it’s relatively simple. It’s about having the confidence to do it.”
Seagrave’s initial foray into investing may have felt like a “leap of faith”, but he has built up his knowledge and learned to trust his instinct more over time. “The main thing is learning how important compounding is,” he says, referring to the reinvestment of interest back into the initial pot of money. “It’s simple really, but the earlier you start the more you gain exponentially. If I was to need access to cash at the moment I’d be out of pocket because the market is down, but I believe long term it’s the right thing to do. I’m glad I started back when I did – I just wish I had learned about it about five or 10 years earlier.”

"Stella McCartney opened her winter show not with pyrotechnics or a light display but seven dappled grey horses galloping around the sandy equestrian centre of France’s oldest riding school, L’École Militaire.
It was the first time the British designer had shown living animals on the catwalk, but that was the point. “There is so much leather, fur and feathers on these runways, particularly in winter. I just wanted to show that you could show animals in a different way,” she said.
There was some front row chatter about the display, choreographed by the horse whisperer Jean-François Pignon. Some found it distracting, others worse. McCartney was at pains to reassure the audience that the horses were “trained by him in a cruelty-free way” and “accustomed to being around large groups of humans”, the brand said in a statement. Backstage, McCartney added: “The difference is that these animals are alive and my clothes haven’t killed anything.”
The most striking examples of this were the outerwear and the bags. The coats and jackets were long with pointy shoulders and cropped with nipped-in waists, and came in red, black and white versions of quilted vegan leather alternative and responsibly sourced yarn. The “leather” bags and boots were made from grapes, apples and mushrooms.
In the label’s 22 years, McCartney has never used leather, feathers, fur or skins, making her a fashion outlier. Although almost every label has now banned fur, and while it is rare to see a show that doesn’t nod in some ways towards “sustainability”, leather has featured in almost every Paris show. McCartney’s aim has always been to prove that you can make “beautifully designed clothes” using alternative materials, the idea being that you shouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the two.
If the vocabulary can feel overwhelming at times – “forest-friendly viscose satin” is a bit of a head-scratcher – she’s keen to point out that while “it doesn’t seem that exciting, in science it’s a big deal”, she said. “Every time you eat an apple, you’re basically eating a handbag.” For the first time, she said, the label has also been able to dye the mushroom leather, meaning the difference between real and fake is imperceptible.
As fashion’s leading voice of that easy, breezy, cool-girl-at-school aesthetic as much as she is of sustainability and animal rights, it’s not simply a case of balancing the eco-books. It’s about selling clothes. Being who she is – a McCartney, and former It girl – she’s savvy enough to know that her childhood and past can feed into her work.
Her most famous collection when she worked at Chloé featured horse prints in 2001. A keen rider, she made knitwear based on horse blankets and transplanted a photograph of a rearing horse by her sister Mary and another by her late mother, Linda, on to flapping regenerative cotton shirts and lace-detailed slip dresses. Q Lazzarus’s Goodbye Horses also played through the equestrian public address system.
As much a fashion revisionist as a revolutionary – the designer made her name around the new millennium – the rest of the collection was characterised by her signature low-slung 00s waistlines. From the shrunken boho waistcoats to the banana-shaped trousers and ultra-slim “hipsters” with built-in body chains, Y2K fashion really isn’t going anywhere.
McCartney’s commitments have put her in a curious position as an environmentalist and activist within the luxury fashion industry. She insists: “LVMH [the conglomerate that part owns Stella McCartney] have been open to the whole concept – I mean, they’re letting me sit here and talk about the relationship between killing animals and making fashion.”
Yet the question over making animal-free clothes affordable to a mass market remains one of fashion’s sticking points. “At least we’re all in this together,” she said."

"Asda and Morrisons are rationing fresh produce including tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers amid shortages caused by poor weather in Europe and north Africa as experts warn that the problems could last for weeks.
UK producers said supplies from British farms would also be hit as many have cut back planting amid the rising cost of heating greenhouses to grow salad crops.
The National Farmers’ Union president, Minette Batters, said further rationing of salad items was on the cards because of the impact of higher energy costs on British growers.
She told the NFU’s annual conference in Birmingham on Tuesday: “Domestic production of salad, including cucumbers and tomatoes, has fallen to its lowest level since records began in 1985.”
Batters added that energy-intensive producers needed help with their bills: “We can do something about it, but it needs government to act to drive down inflation in primary production.”
Morrisons is putting limits of two per item on packs of tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and peppers from Wednesday.
Asda said on Tuesday it was limiting shoppers to three items each on eight fresh produce lines – including broccoli, cauliflower, raspberries and lettuces – to ensure all customers could get what they need.
A spokesperson said: “Like other supermarkets, we are experiencing sourcing challenges on some products that are grown in southern Spain and north Africa.
“We have introduced a temporary limit of three of each product on a very small number of fruit and vegetable lines, so customers can pick up the products they are looking for.”
Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Aldi and the Co-op are not currently planning to introduce restrictions.
The problem with UK salad crops comes after field crops were badly damaged by frost before Christmas.
Tim O’Malley, the managing director of the supplier Nationwide Produce, said: “UK field crops such as carrots, parsnips, cauliflower and cabbage have been badly damaged by frost leading to many fields being totally written-off. This will mean both gaps on shelves and higher prices for these products over the coming months.”
The rationing at Asda and Morrisons comes after importers said that supplies of salad and field crops had been affected by a mixture of unseasonable weather in Spain and southern Europe and storms in the Mediterranean combined with a reduction in the amount of crops planted in heated glasshouses in the Netherlands, another big producer country, as energy bills have soared.
Industry insiders have said availability of produce is down by between 30% and 40% on some crops, with the pepper harvest down 70% in Spain, according to the catering supplier Reynolds. Wholesale prices have also shot up to three times normal levels in some cases, adding to inflation in stores as well as empty shelves.
At this time of the year Murcia, in southeastern Spain, produces an estimated 80% of many salad and vegetable crops sold in the UK. Production in Britain does not usually begin until March.
Italy, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt are often used as alternative sources of supply to Spain in winter, but these areas have also had cold weather in recent weeks, and shipments from Morocco have also been held up by storms.
The problems come as UK importers continue to struggle with the increased costs and paperwork caused by Brexit, which has added to hold-ups at the border.
Some suppliers said potential bureaucratic hurdles meant the UK was not the first choice for hard-pressed European producers, although others said leaving the EU was not a factor in the current supply issues.
Batters said that, while Brexit and the pandemic had added costs to domestic food production, the big challenges for British salad growers were energy costs and lower returns for their produce.
Lee Stiles, secretary of the Lea Valley Growers Association, which represents a large group of greenhouse growers in Hertfordshire, said UK production of crops under glass such as tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers was likely to be 30% down this year on last year.
“You would normally see British salad produce on supermarket shelves this time of year. However, the growers could not achieve the economic price to plant and so have left the glasshouses empty,” he said.
“If the supermarkets had supported growers with an additional cost price increase they would have planted.”
Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said disruption on fruit and vegetables coming from southern Europe and north Africa was expected to last a few weeks. However, he added: “Supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce.”
The farming minister, Mark Spencer, told reporters at the NFU conference that there were “huge pressures in the energy market” but that he did not expect to see supermarkets having to ration food."

"Nthenya Mwendwa: How the Oscars changed the life of a Kenyan designer
- Published
Kenyan fashion designer Nthenya Mwendwa is in Los Angeles with the aim of getting her luxury bags worn and photographed on the Oscars red carpet.
Mwendwa's bags are available for celebrities to take from a so-called ""gifting suite"". At these events, products are displayed in hotel rooms and stars are invited along to choose things for free.
The hope is they will endorse the brand or even wear items on the red carpet.
The 37-year-old's luxury bags have been chosen before, but Mwendwa has never been in Hollywood to see all glitz and glamour for herself.
A partnership between the Kenyan government and an Oscars gifting suite company last year led to her creations being featured.
One of her designs was picked by award-winning US actress Viola Davis.
The minute that happened her sales went through the roof.
""They were like, man, we'd better buy a bag from her before she gets super expensive,"" Mwendwa, whose bags can cost anything from $150 (£125) and $420 (£350), told the BBC.
'Midnight screaming'
The global exposure provided a much-needed boost after the Covid pandemic and hugely increased Mwendwa's sales in Africa.
""All of a sudden, Kenyans are really starting to take notice. They're like, where's this girl been hiding? She's been doing all these big things.""
Then in February, one of Mwendwa's bracelet handbags was featured in a gifting suite for the Grammy Awards, which was packed full of music's biggest names.
She got lucky and her bag was picked up by Bianca Atterberry, a US singer-songwriter also known as Blush.
""It was a red fish leather wristlet. It's just a little purse. You can basically just fit your lipstick, your credit card and your phone. It's something really easy and casual to wear, but also very elegant,"" Mwendwa said.
""That was such a big surprise. And then when it clicked that she was carrying it on the red carpet, oh my gosh.""
She was at home in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, when pictures of Blush wearing her bag were posted online. Her phone blew up, but as it was the middle of the night in Kenya she had no-one to celebrate with.
""I was basically screaming on my own because everybody was asleep… it was amazing.""
This has all pushed sales beyond the African continent, and Mwendwa says Beyoncé's producer has even been in touch.
""It's really nice now because people actually recognise me for my work.""
Preserving Maasai motifs
Her bags are made from sustainable materials like discarded fish leather and cow hide; they also feature intricate bead-work.
This is influenced by her mother, who is Maasai and originally comes from Kajiado County in the south-west of Kenya, where Mwendwa employs young Maasai women to do the bead-work for the bags.
The fashion entrepreneur says it makes her truly happy to work with the community and help ensure traditional Maasai bead-work is valued beyond being sold as tourist trinkets.
For different Maasai communities the bead-work represents different things - with their own patterns and colours.
""The bead-work from Tanzania is all white and then the beadwork from my mum's hometown is different [from that in Narok County, which neighbours Kajiado].
""So I really wanted to preserve these stories because I felt like they were starting to disappear and people didn't know that information, that it can tell you down to a clan just by looking at the beading motif.""
Working at a community level to do the leather and bead-work all chimes with her desire to build a business based on sustainability - and no bag her label makes is ever the same.
'Mind-blowing invite'
Celebrity endorsements have also changed how Mwendwa, who studied at Arsutoria - a prestigious bag and shoe design school in the Italian city of Milan - works.
""It's made me think a little bit differently now in terms of the international market.
""If one bag is seen on the red carpet, what's the next line that I will design, or the next collection? You know, how will that look if it was on the red carpet?
""It's changed my perspective in terms of how I design now.""
To be invited to the Oscars this year is ""mind-blowing"", says Mwendwa, who was asked by the DPA Luxe Gift Suite as she now works directly with them.
She is hopeful that being there in person to promote her bags will lead to even bigger things.
It may initially set back her firm TheLabelSaba - giving away products away for free - but the fanfare should reap rewards for her and those who help create the bags.
""I am really grateful for this opportunity to shine a spotlight on my heritage and to be able to share our stories through the beautiful bags."""
"Editor’s Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In February, we’re exploring the people, places and journeys working to make tourism more sustainable.
Window or aisle? Near the lavatory or closer to the cockpit? Meal or no meal?
When Gilbert Ott was specifying the booking of his overnight New York to London flight, he noticed something new in the list of meal preferences: in addition to options like a kosher or vegetarian meal, there was the choice to skip food service entirely.
He duly chose no food. It’s something, he says, all air passengers should think about doing.
“I skip meals no matter how I fly,” says Ott, who wrote about his experience on his blog, God Save the Points. “The idea of eating at midnight throws off your whole next day, and I think there’s credible science that it hurts your ability to recover from jet lag.”
While not everyone is as thrilled with the prospect of skipping meals on board as Ott is, a few airlines, including Delta (which Ott was flying) and Japan Airlines (JAL), are using the “thanks but no thanks” option.
The jury is still out on whether this will catch on with passengers long term.
Why meals matter
Currently, the “skip meal” option is only available to some passengers flying in Delta’s business class Delta One cabin. A rep from the airline tells CNN that since the program started last year, about 1,000-1,500 meals are voluntarily declined each month.
That means only .3% of eligible passengers are opting out. But it’s a test case for what airlines could do to reduce fuel, costs and waste on board.
According to airlines, the “no meals” option isn’t just about being eco-friendly. It’s also about personalization.
“We’re always looking for ways to better serve our customers and create a more personalized onboard experience,” says a rep from Delta.
Meals also represent an opportunity for airlines to gather more customer data and potentially better optimize catering options.
Is it just greenwashing?
Critics of meal-skipping programs say that airlines might be “greenwashing” by trying to hide a corner-cutting measure under the veneer of sustainability.
In 2020, when JAL launched its meal-skipping option, the airline offered fliers a complimentary amenity kit in exchange for passing on a meal.
One critic, Gary Leff of the blog View from the Wing, called the amenity kit “a token” and argued that the program put too much onus on the passenger to make a change rather than the airline itself.
“I suppose it’s ethical of Japan Airlines to save money by reducing food waste, but is it an ethical obligation for the passenger to make their meal decisions at least 25 hours prior to departure, in other words, to know whether their future self is going to be hungry?” he wrote.
The JAL program began as a test on a few limited routes. Now, it’s available for passengers in any class of service on any international flight.
Originally, it was called the “ethical meal skip option,” but the word “ethical” has been dropped since then. The amenity kit offer has ended, replaced by a partnership with a charity called Table for Two.
The airline says that for each meal foregone, it will donate a small amount to this charity, which provides school lunches to children living in poverty. However, the airline doesn’t specify how much money it donates or which schools or regions are served.
Will travelers feel good about themselves if they make a “green” choice? Or will they just feel hungry?
“From a customer’s perspective, you do feel like you’re being cheated,” says Joaquin Hidalgo, who, alongside Meiling Chen, took a deep dive into the world of airplane industry waste for their graduate thesis at MIT in 2022.
“But I think what they should be more informed about, I should say, is the complexity of the whole thing and really what goes into the whole supply chain of really getting catering into the planes.”
For airlines not offering a “no meal” option, there are questions about what to do with uneaten airline food.
One common suggestion is donating them to food banks or shelters. But strict levels of regulation in the airline industry, plus differing laws at airports, mean it’s next to impossible even if the meals remain sealed shut the whole time. The same regulations that prevent travelers from bringing fruit, meat or other foods across borders also come into play.
So what does happen to uneaten airline food? Some airlines allow flight attendants to eat untouched business or first class meals. But the majority of the time, they are either incinerated or dumped in a landfill.
Hidalgo thinks that the aviation industry could go in this same direction as hotels that offer guest incentives for forgoing daily bedsheet changes or simply the ecological benefit.
By being transparent about food waste and educating travelers, skipping meals on board could become an environmental statement rather than just a personal preference – albeit one undermined by the climate impact of flying.
What if I change my mind?
Ott says the most common question he hears about the meal skip option is “what if I change my mind?” After all, when you’re in a metal tube in the sky, you can’t just pull over and grab a snack.
Many airlines stock snacks on board, especially on long-haul flights. They’re not always free of charge, but the knowledge you won’t starve midair is valuable.
If you’re sure of yourself and know what you like, Ott says any customization option is good.
In Ott’s case, he flies the same JFK-Heathrow route at least once a month and has his travel routine down cold, from sleeping habits to what he stows in his carry-on.
He also knows that he’ll continue to say “no thanks” to plane food, no matter how tempting it may seem.
“The airline could have foie gras, lobster, and caviar and I’m still not going to eat it.”"

"- SVB's was a leading provider of venture capital to climate startups.
- The bank's crash left a financing gap in the climate-tech sector, founders told The New York Times.
- New lenders scrambled to set up relief funds for SVB's clients.
The fall of Silicon Valley Bank leaves a major financing gap for companies developing climate solutions like solar farms and carbon-removal technology. That could make it harder for startups to get funding and scale their operations.
SVB's website says the bank worked with more than 1,550 clients in the climate-tech and sustainability sector, particularly community solar. The bank also says it led or participated in 62% of community-solar financing deals, worth about $3.2 billion in total. And according to ImpactAlpha, SVB was a leading provider of venture debt to climate startups.
""Silicon Valley Bank was in many ways a climate bank,"" Kiran Bhatraju, the founder and CEO of Arcadia, the largest community-solar manager in the country, told the New York Times. ""When you have the majority of the market banking through one institution, there's going to be a lot of collateral damage.""
Federal regulators closed SVB on Friday following a run on deposits. The move has stoked fears that climate startups will face a tougher road than many of them already do.
Arcadia withdrew most of its money from SVB last week, Bhatraju told the Times, but he raised concerns about other solar developers who relied on the bank for loans and lines of credit to build their projects and now need to find other sources of funding.
Ethan Cohen-Cole, the cofounder and CEO of Capture6, a startup developing facilities for carbon removal and storage, is an SVB client. Cohen-Cole told the Times that he expects to be able to pay his 20 employees because of the $250,000 insurance payout from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The company had about $4 million in accounts managed by SVB.
The fallout has led to a network of climate startups, venture-capital firms, and other lenders to mobilize their resources and help blunt the impact, Impact Alpha reported. A handful of fundraising initiatives emerged in recent days to help founders who need short-term cash. These include efforts by the Open Road Alliance, which provides bridge loans to social-impact companies, and Enduring Planet, which provides growth capital to climate entrepreneurs.
Dimitry Gershenson, the cofounder and CEO of Enduring Planet, told the Times that within 24 hours, his group received nearly 100 applications, representing more than $500 million in assets at risk.
Climate tech has been a bright spot in the broader tech downturn, with venture-capital and private-equity funds raising $64 billion in the fiscal year that ended in November — more than double the previous year's total, according to an analysis by Climate Tech VC."
"- Phoebe Gates said the worst part of her TikTok fame is ""misconceptions"" about her family.
- The 20-year-old daughter of Bill Gates said people have ""conspiracy theories"" about them.
- The youngest Gates told The Information that people follow her “because of my family name.”
Bill Gates' youngest daughter said the worst part about being famous on TikTok was the false opinions people have about her family.
Phoebe Gates told The Information the greatest downside to posting on the platform was all the ""misconceptions and conspiracy theories.""
The 20-year-old has more than 64,000 followers on TikTok and gives viewers a glimpse into her life with the Microsoft cofounder and her mother, Melinda French Gates. Her parents divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.
""I'm pretty realistic that people start following me because of my family name. And people probably find it funny to see my dad being a goof and playing Boxbollen,"" Gates told The Information in an email.
She added: ""But once they follow me, they stick around, and I think some of that is because of the issues that I post about, like women's health. And honestly, TikTok is fun.""
Gates recently shared clips from a ""contraceptive talk with my mom"" and a comical video of her dad dancing when he was younger. She posted one video that shows Bill Gates playing a ""boxball"" game, which has been viewed 8.3 million times since December.
Phoebe is the youngest of Bill and Melinda Gates' three children. She studies at Stanford University and has interned at British Vogue. She also uses her social media to speak about the need for sustainability in fashion.
She's planning to launch a start-up called Phia later this year with her Stanford roommate and climate campaigner Sophia Kianni. ""We're building out an idea to help make fashion more sustainable ... social media is going to be a big part of that,"" Phoebe told The Information.
Phoebe said her mom was ""supportive and curious"" about her use of social media and said she ""gets"" that it's a place for young people to grow, per The Information. ""My dad publishes a lot on social, but he doesn't follow it much himself,"" she added.
Phoebe also told the outlet she gets criticized by some users whenever she posts a picture of her boyfriend, another Stanford student, who is Black: ""It's 2023. I'm done being memed for being in an interracial relationship.""
Phoebe Gates didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider."
"Bottled water booming despite worries over waste
- Published
Environmental campaigner Hemantha Withanage is adamant that the purchase of plastic-bottled water should be discouraged.
""Damage from plastics is irreversible,"" the chair of Friends of the Earth International tells the BBC.
""Once fragmented into microplastics, it pollutes all of the ecosystem including the oceans and the air we breathe, with no way to recover them.""
The bottled water industry raises strong emotions from its opponents, who like Mr Withanage point to the environmental impact of all the waste plastic.
And, with only 2.3% of bottled water coming in glass bottles, there is a lot of plastic.
In the US alone, 50 billion plastic water bottles are purchased every year, according to one report. The study adds that only 9% of plastic bottles sold globally are currently recycled.
The industry counters that today's bottles, made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), are 100% recyclable. And in the UK, 75% of PET bottles are recycled. Plus, they are increasingly they are made from already recycled PET in the first place.
Others point to bottled water being healthier than sugary soft drinks. And then there were the recent scandals about contaminated tap water in the US.
What is certain is that the global bottled water sector continues to boom. The industry is expected to enjoy revenues of $324.4bn (£266bn) this year. And that number is tipped to jump to $419.9bn by 2029.
This growth is being led by sparkling water, sales of which are more than doubling.
Global Trade
Simon Oldham, joint managing director of Scottish bottled water brand Highland Spring, confirms the increased demand for the fizzy version.
""During the pandemic, sparkling water in particular saw strong growth, as consumers sought out low/no alcohol drinks that kept them hydrated and offered versatility,"" he says.
Mr Oldham adds that the overall increase in sales of bottled water ""has been driven by an increased health and wellbeing awareness... with consumers seeking healthy choices and alternatives to both sugary soft drinks and alcoholic beverages"".
Jill Culora, vice president of communications for the US-based International Bottled Water Association, says that for many people bottled water is a health necessity.
""For many economically developing countries, bottled water serves as a partial solution when safe drinking water is not available,"" she says. ""Many countries have not built the necessary public water distribution systems. For those countries, bottled water is often their only source of safe water.
""Bottled water is also available in times of emergencies and natural disasters because the bottled water market is strong and viable throughout the year. Sometimes, water from tap water systems can be compromised after emergency situations or natural disasters.""
But in the developed world, what is wrong with tap water for the vast majority of people? ""Nothing,"" says water expert Cristina Villanueva.
An associate research professor at the Barcelona-based Institute for Global Health, she has spent years researching water. Ms Villanueva thinks that there is likely one significant factor behind the continuing boom in bottled water sales.
""The publicity and marketing of the bottled water industry, and [by contrast], a lack of publicity for public water supplies, probably has a main role, at least in countries like Spain,"" she says.
She adds that while health authorities have a duty to ensure that mains water is safe, they would do well to be more transparent. More information about water quality would help ease people's concern, she says.
Regarding bottled water specifically, Ms Villanueva says with much coming from natural springs, she is concerned that these sources ""are prone to overexploitation"" - that too much water is being extracted.
Simon Oldham says that is definitely not the case at Highland Spring, which comes from the Ochil Hills in Perthshire. ""We extract no more than 3% of the rain that falls on our catchment, ensuring the long-term sustainability of one of the planet's more valuable resources for generations to come,"" he says.
""We are also very fortunate that Scotland's climate has high levels of rainfall throughout the year.""
For anyone concerned about the quality of their tap water, an alternative to buying bottled water is to use a home water purification system, such as one fitted under your sink, or the filters that slot into dedicated water jugs.
This is also a booming global sector, with one recent report predicting that it will more than double from $22.6bn last year to $50.7bn in 2029.
In Israel more than three quarters of the country's drinking water now comes from desalinated plants on the Mediterranean coast. Other countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also heavily reliant upon desalinated water, which tastes very flat and lifeless.
To improve the flavour of this water, and to help remove the chlorine, Israel firm Mayu makes a water jug system called ""Swirl"". This comprises a 1.5 litre glass carafe that sits on top of a porcelain base unit.
The latter is battery-powered, and when turned on it creates an oxygenating spiral motion in the water in the carafe, which is said to improve its taste.
Mayu users can also buy a mineral blend to add to the water to mimic the flavour of their favourite bottled water, and to return the nutritional value.
Shay Eden, a co-founder at the company, says that the technology also improves tap water in Europe and the US. ""In some European cities, the average age of the pipes [in the last mile to people's homes] is over 75 years,"" she says.
""Unfortunately, this means that many contaminants are dissolved into the water during its journey before reaching the glass.""
Back in Barcelona, Cristina Villanueva says ""there is no one solution that fits all"". ""You have to consider the options whether it's bottled, tap, or filtered water, taking into account the specific issues where you live and decide your personal choice."""
"The clean energy hub of the future
422,066 views | Rebekah Shirley • TED Countdown Dilemma Series
Why aren't more people investing in Africa's green energy? Environmental researcher Rebekah Shirley outlines the continent's immense potential for renewable power and calls for collaborative international investment -- and partnership -- in Africa's climate future. ""Let's cut past the talk and focus on unleashing the avalanche of a clean energy future that Africa is ready to deliver,"" says Shirley."
"When a fan-led review, chaired by the former sports minister Tracey Crouch, explored ways to redistribute football income to non-Premier League clubs, the indignant chief executive of Leeds United, Angus Kinnear, denounced the project as akin to “Maoist collective agriculturalism”. Pace Mr Kinnear, as the upper reaches of the national game risk becoming a private playground for American hedge funds and sportswashing states, a more collectivist mindset in football is exactly what is required.
The publication of this week’s football white paper – which draws heavily on the Crouch review’s proposals – is a landmark moment, and a step in that direction. The most eye-catching part of the plan is the creation of the first independent regulator of men’s football in England, charged with protecting the integrity and sustainability of the game at all levels. After three decades in which English football’s elite clubs have moved into a different orbit from the rest, and a laissez-faire ownership culture has opened the door to unscrupulous buyers, this is overdue.
The new regulator would act as a much-needed broker for the common good, in a world where money has been allowed to talk too loudly over other considerations. Perhaps most crucially, given the corrosive financial gulf that has emerged between elite clubs and the rest, the regulator would be given backstop powers to enforce a fairer distribution of income throughout the leagues. The sheer scale of England’s football pyramid is unique, and its clubs are sources of communal pride and identity across the country. A more equitable deal, if it can be enforced, will help preserve the game’s variety and its strength in depth.
Equally welcome are proposed regulator powers to prevent owners removing clubs into lucrative closed-shop competitions such as the aborted European Super League – plans for which prompted a fans’ revolt in 2021. Lower down the leagues, in the wake of the demise of clubs such as Bury and Macclesfield Town, an annual licensing system would help ensure sound business models, together with a beefed-up owners’ and directors’ test. It is also right that after years of campaigning for these kinds of reforms, fans are finally promised a greater say in the running of the clubs they sustain. As with other aspects of the white paper though, the devil here will be in the detail.
Taken as a package, the proposals offer a chance to reassert collective values which have become obscured since the Premier League was formed three decades ago. Established through a breakaway by clubs from the old First Division, the Premier League has become the brashest, richest and most watched league in world football. As a sporting spectacle it can be dazzling and compelling. But a moral compass has sometimes been missing in the midst of a relentless pursuit of wealth, power and prestige.
There is one notable lacuna. The sports minister, Stuart Andrew, has said that the enhanced owners’ and directors’ test would not be relevant to the most high-profile ethical dilemma facing English football – its growing exploitation as a source of soft power by super-rich authoritarian states wishing to clean up their global image. On Sunday, the Carabao Cup final will be contested by Newcastle United, owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, and Manchester United, currently the subject of a multibillion-pound bid by the son of a former Qatari prime minister.
A Qatari takeover of Manchester United would encapsulate the sense that, at the very highest level, English football’s soul is up for sale. If an independent football regulator cannot wrestle with these sorts of ownership issues, then governments must find another way to do so."
"Back in October, Framework announced that it would further its sustainability efforts by offering refurbished units at a discount.

Pritzker Prize 2023: David Chipperfield wins 'Nobel of architecture'

Pritzker Prize 2023: David Chipperfield wins 'Nobel of architecture'
Throughout its 44-year history, the Pritzker Prize — regarded as the ""Nobel of architecture"" — has often been awarded to individuals with distinct design signatures: Frank Gehry's irregular forms, Zaha Hadid's sweeping curves, Tadao Ando's textural concrete.
It may be a sign of the times that 2023's laureate, Sir David Chipperfield, has been praised by the prize's judges for precisely the opposite.
""A gifted architect can sometimes almost disappear,"" reads the jury's citation, published Tuesday as the 69-year-old was unveiled as the latest recipient of his profession's highest honor. ""We do not see an instantly recognizable David Chipperfield building in different cities,"" it adds, ""but different David Chipperfield buildings designed specifically for each circumstance.""
Although best-known for cultural institutions, like Des Moines Public Library in Iowa, the UK's Turner Contemporary gallery and his reimagined Neues Museum in Berlin, the English architect's firm has completed over 100 buildings around the world. Spanning residential, commercial and public uses, the understated works are not defined by trademark motifs but by Chipperfield's insistence on answering what he calls the unique ""questions"" posed by each project.
""I'm not that interested in architecture as an autobiographical exercise,"" he said on a video call from London. ""(We) are sort of a midwife in this process. When we finish a building, we go home — we leave it, and it belongs to somebody else (and) we're not there to justify it and sell it anymore. It has to sell itself.""
Speaking to CNN ahead of Tuesday's announcement, Chipperfield partly — and modestly — attributed his approach to a ""lack of talent,"" describing himself as ""not an original genius in the way some, like Frank Gehry, are."" He also recognized that architects often have little choice but to stamp their identity on their work.
""Architects have become products. And products have to be distinguishable from each other,"" he said, adding: ""So, they profile themselves, shape themselves and present themselves in slight opposition to each other. In a way, their signature and their autograph become part of their branding, and therefore their corporate and commercial success. I've somehow been shy of that, or at least I found that counterproductive.""
As the prize's jury attests, Chipperfield's apparent lack of ego (in an industry that often glorifies great individuals) has proven an asset. He is the latest in a string of Pritzker laureates with few, or even no, conventionally iconic buildings to their name. Last year's prize was awarded to Burkina Faso-born Francis Kéré, whose career has been largely committed to schools, health centers and community facilities in Africa. The year before, design duo Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal, best known for renovating France's postwar social housing buildings, claimed the honor.
First awarded to American architect Philip Johnson in 1979, the Pritzker Prize continues to recognize what it describes as architects' ""consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment."" But within that broad remit, the merits on which winners are judged appear to be evolving. So, might Chipperfield's victory herald a wider shift, not only in architecture but society at large?
""I hope you're a little bit right,"" Chipperfield said. ""The period ... distinguished by the sort of 'icon' architecture of the last 30 years — I'm hoping that's a bit in the past now. It does, within the perspective of sustainability and social inequality, start to look a little bit irrelevant.""
Master of the museum
None of this is to say that Chipperfield's buildings lack gravitas. Look no further than the stepped atrium of BBC Scotland's headquarters or the daring cantilevered slabs of his America's Cup Building in Valencia, Spain. He has also flirted with unconventional shapes, such as the jagged sawtooth roof of the Museo Jumex in Mexico City.
What unites these seemingly disparate forms is a respect for each site's context and an emphasis on process. How a building was made, why it was made, what it was made from and who it was made for should, Chipperfield said, matter more than the ""beauty parade estimation of architecture as image.""
""In our culture, the visual has dominated because it's much easier to see a building on the front of an in-flight magazine than it is (to) experience it... I think we're shifting now. And I think the visual and the formal will become very subordinate to process. How we build, what we build, where the materials come from — the whole supply chain, both in terms of sustainability and even in terms of ethics — will become the important things. And we will see beauty in a different way.""
""Architecture is about experience and substance, more than fleeting imagery,"" he added.
In winning the Pritzker Prize, Chipperfield joins a list of modern architectural greats that includes two of his former bosses: Norman Foster and the late Richard Rogers, winners in 1999 and 2007, respectively. Having graduated in the late 1970s, he joined their respective offices as they began to wield ""a very big influence,"" he recalled.
Chipperfield's work may, on its surface, share little in common with a pair known for ""high-tech"" designs that celebrated their underlying engineering through bold displays of exposed steel, glass and aluminum. But, he said, he inherited from them a collaborative approach — one that views architecture as the work of teams, not lone geniuses.
""In order to (produce) a building, you need a structural engineer, a mechanical engineer, someone who's really helping you manage the costs,"" he added. ""And often those people are at arm's length... Norman Foster and Richard Rogers both brought those professionals to the table as part of the design process. And that was a real shift.""
After setting up his own firm in 1984, Chipperfield completed a series of commissions in Japan, where his modest approach chimed with the country's own minimalist aesthetic. He has gone on to build more outside the UK than within it, working extensively in continental Europe, North America and Asia, while opening offices in Berlin, Milan and Shanghai.
One of his early successes was, however, completed in his home country: The River and Rowing Museum, in the British town of Henley, which nodded to the Thames' traditional wooden boat sheds. His firm has since become something of a museum specialist, with its portfolio of institutions ranging from the Zheijiang Museum of Natural History in China to the Anchorage Museum in Alaska.
These buildings often offer generous public gestures, like the huge waterfront promenade of Shanghai's West Bund Museum, which serves as the Centre Pompidou's first Chinese outpost. Chipperfield also frequently employs local materials — like aggregates made of stone and sand sourced from the Missouri River, that give texture to the polished concrete of Saint Louis Art Museum's extended East Wing.
Whatever the commission, Chipperfield's museums aim to dispel the notion that cultural institutions are stuffy or elitist.
""The museum has, since the 19th century, evolved from being a temple for the educated to a... place that should have a much more democratic and wider outreach,"" he said, adding: ""The challenge of cultural institutions is not to get people who normally go to cultural institutions to go to them, but to encourage other people to go there.""
With this, comes another principle that underpins his works: That a museum's building should not outshine what is found within.
""Museums... give architects a lot of freedom,"" he said. ""And sometimes they've used that freedom to make the museum more about the architecture than it is about their contents.""
Navigating history
Many of Chipperfield's most celebrated projects are — unusually for a major architect — works of restoration and renovation, rather than structures built from scratch.
He has been tasked with lightly treading on some of the world's most delicate architectural sites, whether refurbishing Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin or designing China's new London embassy on the site of Britain's former Royal Mint. (The latter was effectively halted in December, after local officials blocked plans on security grounds).
His transformation of Berlin's mid-19th-century Neues Museum, which was badly damaged during bombing in World War II, is meanwhile considered among his firm's greatest triumphs. Upon its reopening in 2009, Germany's then-chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly described Chipperfield's work as ""impressive and extraordinary,"" while calling Neues ""one of the most important museum buildings in European cultural history.""
His restrained ethos seems well-suited to such tasks. Bringing old buildings back to life is not just about restoring function but creating a dialogue between past and present — balancing respect for history with the need for change. By reinterpreting old forms and giving them new relevance, Chipperfield has deftly charted a course between the two.
""We're now talking about conservation as progress,"" he said, arguing that growing calls to protect heritage should not just apply to recognized monuments.
""We need to reuse — and question the knocking down of — less significant buildings (too), not only from a position of resource, but also in terms of what a city means. If we knock things down every 20 years and start again, the city loses a lot of its charm and meaning because cities are cumulative, physically and socially.""
Even before the Pritzker Prize announcement, Chipperfield was among the world's most decorated living architects. He was knighted in 2010 and won both the Mies van der Rohe Award and RIBA Royal Gold Medal the next year before becoming the first British architect to curate the Venice Architecture Biennale.
Having judged various awards, Chipperfield knows that major prizes are often used either to thank architects for a lifetime's work or to provide encouragement earlier in their careers (either a ""pat on the head"" or ""a pat on the bottom,"" as he put it). But while he sees himself as ""more in the former than the latter,"" he is arguably now producing the best work of his career.
His firm's James-Simon-Galerie building, whose colonnaded courtyard welcomes visitors to Berlin's historic Museum Island, was shortlisted for the prestigious 2021 RIBA International Prize. And Chipperfield's restoration of the Procuratie Vecchie, in Venice's St. Mark's Square, meanwhile opened the grand structure to the public in 2022 for the first time in its 500-year history. Traditional artisans restored its centuries-old flooring and other historical fittings, while rooftop terraces and new exhibition spaces invite visitors into places previously hidden from view.
His firm has more than two dozen other projects underway. The most recently announced of them will see the plinth at Athens' neoclassical National Archaeological Museum extended to free up space for underground galleries. Fittingly, the Greek capital has been chosen to host the ceremony at which Chipperfield will be formally awarded the Pritzker Prize. Like previous winners, he will receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medal.
""We don't work for prizes, obviously, and you put them to the back of your mind,"" he said. ""But they're extremely nice when they come along."""

"Scientists from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia have discovered an enzyme called Huc converts air into electrical energy. With the potential to create limitless clean energy, the enzyme (which is found in common soil bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis) consumes hydrogen in the air and turns it into electrical currents. The process is efficient and stable, and Huc can be grown in large quantities, making it a promising breakthrough for sustainability. “Once we produce Huc in sufficient quantities, the sky is quite literally the limit for using it to produce clean energy,” says lead researcher Dr Rhys Grinter.

"The Snapdragon X75 modem is set to push 5G into a new era
The X75 is reaching new heights and setting the bar.
What you need to know
- Qualcomm releases details surrounding the Snapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF system.
- The modem aims to put us into ""the next phase of 5G"" with improved and sustained connectivity in stagger-prone areas like elevators and parking garages.
- The X75 has been designed to increase 5G reliability along with improved Ai-based location accuracy.
- The Snapdragon X75 will land on devices beginning in the second half of 2023.
Qualcomm has introduced a new modem that may send us right into a world of stronger connectivity and speed
Qualcomm's press release unveils the latest Snapdragon X75 modem, which is said to be the ""world's first"" Modem-RF system. The company's technologies division is using its 6th-generation modem-to-antenna solution, which supports 5G Advanced and is said to be ""the next phase of 5G."" With the modem currently in its sampling phase, devices are expected to ship with the product in the second half of 2023.
The Snapdragon X75 is centered around scalability and unmatched 5G performance while also containing its own hardware accelerator tensor. As we await its release later this year, consumers can expect to find several important features of the new Snapdragon X75 modem.
With the X75 looking to achieve a new smartphone connectivity benchmark, it will provide a 10-carrier aggregation for mmWave, 5x downlink carrier aggregation, and FDD uplink MMO for sub-6 GHz bands. Qualcomm has also put forth its Advanced Modem-RF Software Suite for improving sustained 5G performance in areas where connectivity is stagnant, like elevators, parking garages, and subways, meaning better connectivity in spaces where it can be spotty.
To progress the sustainability of a phone's connectivity even more, the Snapdragon X75 will utilize an AI-based sensor-assisted mmWave beam management for 5G reliability and better AI-based location accuracy, similar to what it used in the X70 modem. The transceiver for the mmWave is coupled with Qualcomm's QTM565 fifth-generation antenna modules, which should help lower the cost, board complexity, hardware footprint, and ease the toll on a phone's battery consumption.
The company's 5G PowerSave Gen 4 and RF Power Efficiency Suite act as additional benefactors in extending a phone's battery life.
The Snapdragon X75 contains support for Qualcomm's DSDA Gen 2 for both 5G and 4G dual data on two SIM cards at the same time. Additionally, the Smart Transmit Gen 4 adds the ability of fast, long-range uploads with the added support for Snapdragon Satellite.
To go along with the new Snapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF system, Qualcomm has also unveiled the Snapdragon X72. While this product is also a 5G Modem-RF system, the X72 is optimized more for supporting faster speeds during multi-gigabit downloads and uploads.

"On one thing, politicians, economists and commentators on the left and right can agree: Britain is broken. Not as in the silly, smirking slogan used by David Cameron in opposition, but in the most basic sense. This winter, sick people have died in the hours that it took for ambulances to arrive. This week’s cold snap has again forced many families across the UK to debate whether to heat their homes or feed themselves. On Wednesday, as Jeremy Hunt delivers his budget in parliament, teachers in England and Wales, junior doctors, civil servants, university staff and tube drivers will all be on strike.
The newish chancellor is not even pretending next week’s measures will fix these problems. Perhaps such candour is to his credit. What is shaming is that he doesn’t even try. Getting to the root causes of big issues and turfing out dogma has never been Mr Hunt’s style. To take one example: the Treasury will almost certainly keep down fuel bills by maintaining the energy price guarantee. A U-turn on the policy announced in the autumn by No 11, ministers will hail this as compassionate conservatism – the state mitigating the pain of ordinary people. Yet bills will still be twice what they were in 2021, and the government will once again hand over taxpayer money to energy suppliers in a privatised market that has comprehensively failed.
Emergency measures on energy prices makes sense, but that policy should be combined with a new social tariff system as well as serious action to retrofit houses and expand renewable sources. Fat chance: Mr Hunt’s boss, Rishi Sunak, is the chancellor who blew £1.5bn on a green homes scheme described by the National Audit Office as “botched”. Designed in a rush to a timetable that was a blur, it was the kind of trivial response to a serious problem in which this government specialises (see also levelling up).
The big picture likely to emerge next week is that the short-term outlook for both the economy and public finances has brightened a little. Gas prices in wholesale markets have dropped 80% since last August (although they are still three times what they were in 2020), and tax receipts from national insurance and the self-employed are above previous forecasts. Mr Hunt has wriggle room, should he wish to use it. Much more probable is that he won’t – not yet, when there is still a year or so before a general election.
Politics means that this autumn’s budget is far more likely to be the tax-cutting blockbuster. Next week, in contrast, will perhaps be sold as the budget that was neither shaped by Covid nor drawn up by Kwasi Kwarteng and Liz Truss, that did a little to mitigate the costs of childcare and to encourage businesses to invest. Political stability and financial affordability will be the watchwords; continued stagnation and a decline in relative living standards will be the result. This is not a recipe for election victory, as even the most faithful Tory backbenchers will surely realise. Nor does it offer much to a country battered by 13 years of austerity economics and venal politics.
For all their clownishness, Mr Kwarteng and Ms Truss raised an urgent issue: the British economic and social model is now bust, so what replaces it? Their answers, of tax cuts and deregulation, came out of the Tory jokebook – and fell flat in an economy shocked by rate rises and financial turbulence. Other responses, underpinned by environmental sustainability and social justice, haven’t even been tried at Westminster. But the big question hangs over both this government and the opposition, even if neither side wants to square up to it."

"Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s bid to buy Manchester United would not burden the club with debt if successful, with the billionaire rejecting any leveraged buyout of the type used by the Glazer family.
The Ineos owner hopes to paint himself as a safe custodian of the club he supports and in tune with the values of their fanbase, as rival consortiums prepare to formalise their offers for the 20-times English champions.
Raine, the bank in charge of the sale, has set an initial deadline of Friday for bids. Ineos has made the only publicly confirmed offer and under its plan any debt incurred in financing a takeover would be expected to be put on the books of the petrochemicals company.
A rival offer is expected from Qatar but the vehicle for any proposal remains unknown. On Thursday questions were raised with the Premier League and Uefa over whether a takeover from the Gulf state could be “independent of state influence”.
At this stage, any offers are non-binding. This essentially makes the first round an opportunity for Raine and the Glazer family to gauge the range of interest. Rumours of multiple bidders, from Elon Musk to Apple or Amazon, have been aired over the past week but the Guardian understands any bidding pool this week is likely to be small .
The Glazers will hope to drum up further offers over the coming weeks, and those already in the bidding process are likely to speak more publicly about their intentions.
Earning the trust of a fanbase wounded by the Glazer era will probably form part of any strategy, with Ratcliffe perhaps hopeful that setting out his differences from the current owners will help his cause. The 70-year-old is understood to see any acquisition as an opportunity to shape his legacy.
A Qatari deal would have hurdles to clear with football authorities. On Thursday the human rights organisation FairSquare published a letter calling on Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, and the CEO of the Premier League, Richard Masters, to block any Qatari takeover, arguing: “No consortium of Qatari investors capable of [acquiring Manchester United] would be able to convincingly demonstrate their independence from the Qatari state.”
Uefa rules prevent any owner from exerting “control or influence” over another club in the same European competition. The state-funded Qatar Sports Investments owns Paris Saint-Germain and sources have previously told the Guardian a Qatari deal for United could necessitate changes in Uefa’s rulebook.
In his letter the director of FairSquare, Nicholas McGeehan, argues that it would be impossible to separate any Qatari consortium from the possibility of state funding. “Checks and balances on the way in which funds are distributed and used by the [Qatari] ruling family are minimal to nonexistent,” he writes, “which would undermine any assurances provided about the sources of funding for such an acquisition.”
McGeehan goes on to say: “State ownership of European football clubs jeopardises the integrity of the game, its proclaimed values and its sustainability.”"
"The World Bank president, David Malpass, has announced his resignation months after sparking controversy by failing to say whether he accepted that fossil fuels were driving the climate crisis.
Malpass, who was appointed to the post by Donald Trump in 2019, said he would step down from the multilateral development bank, which provides billions of dollars a year in funding for developing economies, by the end of June.
Malpass offered no specific reason for the decision, and did not explain why he was leaving the bank with less than a year remaining in his five-year term. He said in a statement: “After a good deal of thought, I’ve decided to pursue new challenges.”
However, Malpass’s departure comes just months after he was forced to push back against claims he was a climate crisis denier.
The controversy started after he appeared on a climate finance panel at a conference in New York in September. Asked repeatedly whether he believed “manmade burning of fossil fuels …[are] rapidly and dangerously warming the planet”, Malpass tried to dodge the question before saying: “I don’t even know. I’m not a scientist.”
The answer drew condemnation from the White House, and raised pressure on Malpass, who eventually used an interview with CNN International to try to quell the controversy. “I’m not a denier,” Malpass told the broadcaster.
However, the incident re-ignited calls for a leadership shake-up at the bank, where pressure has been building to pave the way for a new president who would make changes and ensure it responded to the climate crisis more aggressively.
In November 2021, the special adviser to the UN secretary-general on climate change, Selwin Hart, criticised the World Bank for “fiddling while the developing world burns” and said the institution had been an “ongoing underperformer” on climate action.
The US special envoy on climate change, John Kerry, has said he wants to work with Germany to come up with a strategy by the next World Bank Group meetings in April to “enlarge the capacity of the bank” to put more money into circulation and help countries deal with climate breakdown.
Recently, the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, launched a major push to change the way the World Bank operates to ensure broader lending to combat the climate crisis and other global challenges.
Yellen issued a statement thanking Malpass for his service. “The world has benefited from his strong support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion, his vital work to assist the Afghan people, and his commitment to helping low-income countries achieve debt sustainability through debt reduction.”
Yellen said the US would soon nominate a replacement for Malpass and looked forward to the bank’s board undertaking a “transparent, merit-based and swift nomination process for the next World Bank president”.
By longstanding tradition, the US government selects the head of the World Bank, while European leaders choose the leader of its larger partner, the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Malpass took up the role in April 2019 after serving as the top official for international affairs at the US treasury in the Trump administration. In 2022, the World Bank committed more than $104bn (£86bn) to projects around the globe, according to the bank’s annual report.
A source familiar with his thinking said Malpass had informed Yellen of his decision on Tuesday.
The end of the fiscal year at the end of June was a natural time to step aside, the source said. The World Bank’s governors are expected to approve the bank’s roadmap for reforms with only minor changes at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank set for mid-April.
Still, World Bank sources said they were surprised by Malpass’s decision to step down before the joint meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in Morocco in October."
"Rishi Sunak knows what he must do in Northern Ireland. He cannot cringe any longer before that region’s backwoodsmen and their cheerleaders in his own party. Unlike his predecessors, he has nothing to lose, with probably just two years in office. He clearly has a deal on a revised Irish trade protocol with the EU on the table, and he has the parliamentary votes to push it through. His reputation has no time for error.
The partition of Ireland was born a century ago to appease northern Protestant sentiment. That sentiment has ever since abused self-rule – under licence from London – with blatantly sectarian government. This was sustainable as long as trade and citizenship were left fluid across Ireland, with both sides of the border still partners in the European single market.
Brexit crashed that sustainability. Boris Johnson’s (largely personal) fixation that Brexit meant leaving the single market required a trade protocol to keep Irish economic unity intact. Though temporary and a mess, this rescued the Brexit deal. Now Johnson is plotting to undermine Sunak’s clearing of that mess. Red and green lanes will separate internal and “external” Irish commerce, aided by digital technology. Regulatory disputes will be handled by a two-tier process under the European court of justice. This is perfectly sensible, given the nature of Ireland’s geography. All trade is a compromise of sovereignty.
The Protestant DUP was born of objection. It was formed in 1971 and served as a vehicle to oppose things such as the cooperative unionism of the 1980s and the Good Friday peace agreement. Its members were political primitives who called for creationism to be taught in schools. Dusted with the covenant of unionism, they have held the Tory right – and Johnson – in thrall, a toxin on the party’s Westminster backbenches. They represent just a quarter of the region’s population.
Northern Ireland is desperate for a settlement, especially its young people, and for the return of self-government, which the DUP denies in opposing the protocol. The region voted against Brexit and barely half its voters are still firmly committed to the union with Britain. A poll a year ago showed a majority expects Irish reunification within a decade. Perhaps most significant is that declared Catholics now outnumber Protestants. Things are clearly changing.
Yet one concession for resolving the DUP impasse this week is said to be a strengthening of the minority veto in the Stormont assembly. This entrenchment of sectarian “power-sharing” is precisely what has frozen the region’s government for most of a quarter of a century. It should be unthinkable that one party should be free to veto not just facets of Britain’s overseas trade policy but, in effect, any improvement in the UK’s absurdly ill-judged dealings with the EU over Brexit. If the DUP continues to oppose power-sharing, that sharing should be revised, not the protocol.
The dire history of British rule over Ireland merits the “reparation” of some London sympathy for eventual reunion. One day this will come. Protocol revision offers the glue of restored economic unity. Letting the DUP block such a joining would be outrageous. Sunak must know this – and know what he should now do.
Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist
This article was amended on 24 February 2023. The DUP was formed in 1971, not in the 1980s as an earlier version inferred, and the party did not introduce dividing walls into cities in Northern Ireland."
"China must speed up its science and technology development to ensure greater self-reliance, the country’s leader Xi Jinping has told an annual political meeting, as Beijing becomes more isolated by sanctions and other trade concerns.
China’s technological advancement is facing global competition and increasing constraints from foreign governments such as the US, but the sector has also been hindered by Beijing’s own crackdowns and controls.
In a speech to a closed-door meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC) on Sunday, Xi said greater self-reliance and strength in the science and technology field was the path to advancing “high quality development” and building China into “a great modern socialist country”.
“To open up new areas and new arenas in development and foster new growth drivers and new strengths in face of fierce international competition, China should ultimately rely on scientific and technological innovation,” he said, according to a state media readout.
He called for increased cooperation between Chinese industry, academia and research institutes to support “original and pioneering research”.
The annual political meeting of China’s rubber-stamping parliament began on Sunday and will run until next week. The meeting – which runs concurrently to the annual gathering of the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) advisory body for an event known as the “two sessions” – is largely held behind closed doors.
So far, the event has added to growing signs of China’s leadership prioritising self-sustainability.
Among its concerns are US restrictions on Chinese access to US semiconductor and AI technology, on national security grounds, as well as foreign sanctions or restrictions on some Chinese companies and officials over issues including the crackdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and signs of support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing has responded by decrying the use of sanctions.
On Monday, official state media reported what analysts said was a potential new political slogan, “the two must-haves”, citing manufacturing and a dependable grain and food supply that isn’t vulnerable to international markets. Draft budget figures announced on Sunday saw a more than 13% increase in funding for national stockpiling of grain and other base items.
Xi’s comments on Monday were in line with the work report speech delivered the previous day by outgoing premier, Li Keqiang, who called for improvements in national-level mobilisation of resources in the sector.
The finance ministry and state planner also announced modest budget increases for the tech sector, and the acceleration of hard tech infrastructure construction, including in artificial intelligence, 5G and big data.
China’s tech industry has been targeted by a broad government crackdown in recent years, as the CCP sought to rein in the increasingly independent sector and key figures such as Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
Dr Ilaria Carrozza, a senior researcher at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, had previously told the Guardian the crackdown appeared to have eased, or at least been paused, “but I don’t think we should assume they’re going to now let companies do whatever they want”.
The CCP’s challenges in maintaining control over the tech sector and the flow of information more broadly, while also pushing for greater innovation, have been demonstrated in the race to develop AI chatbots. The emergence of the hugely popular US-based ChatGPT – and its subsequent censorship in China – highlighted the difficulties Chinese tech firms are having in developing their own without upsetting the government.
Science and technology minister Wang Zhigang said on Sunday that China would have to “wait and see” if it can develop the same results as ChatGPT, adding that its ability to deliver results in real time was “very difficult to achieve”.

"A week into 2023, young roboticists from New York to New Delhi got the news they'd been waiting for: the theme for the new season of the premier international robotics competition for kids 14 to 18.
The contest, which culminates in April's highly competitive world championship in Houston, is sponsored by For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, or FIRST, a nonprofit promoting science, engineering and technology education. When FIRST robotics season kicks off, participating teams get strict rules -- everything from sizing to scoring to robot restrictions -- for building an industrial-size bot ready to battle a crowded field of like-minded machines.
The high schoolers receive a season-specific kit of parts to get started: screws, bolts, pneumatic tubing, battery plates, bumper brackets. And they get limited time and resources.
This year's ""game,"" dubbed Charged Up, tasks more than 3,300 teams with conceiving, designing and building a bot that addresses challenges related to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 7 -- to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
""By encouraging FIRST participants to think about future energy sustainability, we're also empowering them to be the next generation of leaders and innovators, tackling the world's toughest challenges,"" the organization says of this year's Charged Up theme.
The remotely controlled robots, which aren't allowed to exceed 140 pounds (around 64 kilograms), score points by picking up and placing cones and cubes as they navigate a grid. The competitions meld the high-octane charge of competitive sports with the focused brain power of engineering. FIRST likes to call it ""the ultimate sport for the mind.""
This year's competition will draw kids from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Dominican Republic, India, Israel, Mexico, Poland, Turkey and the US.
So how do busy high schoolers balance the rigors of building a robot with homework, college applications, social demands of teendom and, in some cases, devastating natural disasters and war?
I checked in with one team near me, Highlander Robotics, to find out what it takes to shepherd a robot from concept to fully functioning, competitive machine. The student-led group, also known as Team 8033, started in 2019 with 11 students working out of a mentor's garage and now has more than 50 members from school districts around the San Francisco Bay Area. Twenty experienced mentors help guide the young innovators as they build and program for hours at a time -- sometimes 12 or more over weekends and full days during school breaks -- in a lab at Piedmont High School east of San Francisco.

""Beyond equipping young people with workforce-ready STEM skills, FIRST teaches students about resilience,"" said Chris Moore, the organization's CEO. ""FIRST is a robotics community where kids can find a place to belong, and a place to fail safely; making mistakes and learning from them is a critical part of the overall learning experiences we provide.""
Last year, Highlander Robotics landed at the world championship with its plucky pal Selkie, a speedy wheeled robot with flashing LED lights that can twirl and shoot balls into a hoop. Team 8033 ended up losing its championship semifinal by only six points in a close elimination round and hopes to get even closer to victory with its 2023 model, Paddo the Frog.
But there are hurdles on the road to Houston, where some 600 teams are expected to compete.
Scroll through our gallery to see Highlander Robotics members in action, and get a sense of what other robotics teams around the world likely are up to as the whirlwind of tournament season kicks off."
"In the east of the Netherlands, just 10km from the German border, is Nijmegen, a dynamic and progressive university city that manages to fly under the radar.
This clean, compact city is the oldest in the country, and its number of green initiatives rivals Amsterdam, with residents prioritising quality of life and sustainability. Its historic centre is car-free, it has 60km of cycling ""superhighways"", its buses run on green fuel, and there are schemes in place that encourage car-sharing. It even has the power to inspire others facing climate change disruption.
While no city can be 100% sustainable, Nijmegen is making some of the boldest strides in Europe in this area. They even decommissioned their coal power station in 2016, which has been turned into a solar park that's home to 9,000 solar panels and two wind turbines that power almost 400 homes in the city.
Yet few outside The Netherlands have even heard of it.
""Nijmegen is referred to in Holland as 'Havana near the Waal',"" said Margot Ribberink, a climate activist and the first female Dutch TV meteorologist, referring to the majestic Waal River that cuts the city in two. ""The people here are very open-minded.""

Ribberink and I had met up in Grote Markt, the 15th-Century cobbled square at the heart of the Nijmegen, so she could show me how the city punches above its weight. As we strolled past traditional Dutch townhouses, I breathed the clean, fresh air. One of the mainstreets – Lange Hazelstraat, the oldest street in the Netherlands – was lined with independent shops, vintage boutiques and vegan and vegetarian eateries. I was struck by the potted olive trees lining the litter-free streets, people cycling past on e-bikes and surprisingly few chain shops.
Nijmegen was awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2018, but its progressive roots go back much further. The city has a long history of student activism. It was the centre of Dutch counterculture and protesting back in the 1960s until the mid '80s. In 1963, the Dutch National Student Trade Union Movement was founded here by a student from Nijmegen, named Ton Regtien. By the 1970s, it had become the setting for other socialist gatherings, like women's groups and communes. And today its sustainable values continue to thrive thanks to its large student population.
I fell in love with the city because of the people. Especially the students, who are also very concerned about the world, the environment and the climate
Ribberink came to Nijmegen in the 1980s to study biology. She met her best friends here as well as her partner, and the two settled in Lent, a village on the left bank of the Waal River. ""I fell in love with the city because of the people,"" she said. ""Especially the students, who are also very concerned about the world, the environment and the climate.""

""A lot is happening in Nijmegen around sustainability and the environment,"" she added. ""Radboud University has put sustainability at the top of all relevant fields of study, while businesspeople in the city are active in making our city more sustainable, healthier and greener, including working together to become energy neutral by 2030, and creating options for green mobility and sustainable shops.""
As she told me this, we arrived at Het Duurzame Warenhuis (The Sustainable Department Store), the Netherlands' first and only eco department store, which opened in 2014. The spacious, ground-level shop was a zen-like space, with white walls, low lighting and lots of natural untreated wood. ""We try to stock almost everything you need to live a less-wasteful life,"" explained buyer Lisette Hijink. ""We stock mostly clothing, all of it eco-friendly and fair-trade… We have a sustainable hairdresser on site and a fully vegan kitchen. Zero waste is one of our core values, and reducing waste in our business is important too, which is hard, but we are focused.""
Our next stop was 512 Nijmegen, a stylish and edgy fashion boutique specialising in sustainable clothes and accessories for women. ""I sell mostly sustainable and fair-trade brands,"" said owner, Jettie Wakker. ""We make clothes in either small, medium or large and only a few pieces at a time, so we never have debt or waste."" She added: ""I also know all the people behind the brands I stock. I know their backstories, who their manufacturers and people working for them are.""

I noticed that one side of the shop was filled with plants. ""All of these are pre-loved,"" explained Wakker. ""If people no longer want their plants, they can bring them to us. Every second-hand plant we sell has its own story, which we pass on to the new owner – for example why it was donated, and how old it is. We don't like to throw plants away.""
We wandered into Njmegen's cobbled backstreets for lunch at De Nieuwe Winkel, a vegetarian fine-dining restaurant with two Michelin stars and one Green Michelin star. Opened in 2011, chef Emile van der Staak and his team create experimental multi-course, meat-free tasting menus using an array of herbs, roots, flowers, nuts and plants – some common, others less so – grown in a ""food forest"" in the village of Groesbeek, 13km from the restaurant. If you don't know what you're looking at, this six-acre plot of land resembles an ordinary wood, dense with free-growing shrubs and trees. But there's one main difference: everything in it is edible.
It's the first 'food forest' of its kind in Europe and we're one of the few restaurants around the world collaborating in this way
""It's the first 'food forest' of its kind in Europe and we're one of the few restaurants around the world collaborating in this way,"" said Van der Staak. ""Menus are planned around more than 400 different species of edible plants grown in the forest, such as peach, chestnut, walnut, pawpaw and Japanese plums.""

Surprisingly full after my lunch of acorn seitan kebabs, sunflower-seed risotto and other vegan delights, we hopped aboard the Zonnetrein (Sun Train), a novel and sustainable mode of transport consisting of two connected solar-powered buses for taking visitors on sustainable guided tours of Nijmegen. As I looked onto the vast river Waal, which is the longest river in the Netherlands and spans up to 400m wide at points, it was easy to understand how it has shaped the city, both geographically and psychologically.
That's because life in Nijmegen goes hand in hand with flood risk, making the effects of climate change impossible to ignore.
In 1995, the city experienced one of the worst floods in its recent history. The river burst its banks – or dikes as they're called in the Netherlands – causing major widespread damage and saw 250,000 people temporarily evacuated from their homes. After much debate in the community about how best to protect the city from future flooding, residents voted to create a bypass river, which led to the launch of the aptly named Room for the River project.
For centuries, the Dutch have approached managing river overflows by building dikes to contain the water. Instead, this new project worked with the flow of the water by diverting it. To be effective, the dikes had to be moved and some of the river's original floodplain recreated on the northern side of the river. This meant cutting through the village of Lent, where several homes, including Ribberink's, were located.

""The local government saw this as a chance to change the whole area, which meant clearing 56 houses, including mine,"" said Ribberink. ""Most people were offered money to leave their homes to be demolished. But our farmhouse is considered a monument, so together we decided to move it. We put it on wheels and we moved it 1km in one day. We were on local TV at the time.""
The result is a huge urban regeneration project that has created a haven for wildlife, a city beach and acres of recreational space where people can swim, take classes, listen to concerts and be outside, including a newly created central island that's filled with flowers in spring. The project – which Ribberink described as ""the biggest climate adaptation project in Europe"" – has proven it's possible to improve infrastructure while respecting and considering the environment.
""People in our city love the new environment, especially the island we have for recreation, but, as a climatologist, I think we still need to be aware of the fluctuating water levels,"" said Ribberink. ""We need to remember the summer of 2021 when Germany, Belgium and South Limburg in the Netherlands had catastrophic flooding. This could happen again in the future.""
Nijmegen is making big achievements in sustainability and is a great example for the rest of the world
She added: ""Nijmegen is making big achievements in sustainability and is a great example for the rest of the world. Room for the River has huge power to influence other cities experiencing climate change disruption, especially in the way the local government involved the community to make decisions. Of course, we were shocked to hear we had to leave our homes, but in the end, everybody found a good new place to live and is proud of what the area is like now.""

"T-Mobile and Vail Resorts have signed a multi-year deal that will expand the Uncarrier’s 5G coverage and capacity across 36 of Vail’s US resorts. The investment will be valuable for T-Mobile customers and Vail Resorts staff, particularly as the company is set to launch mobile passes and lift tickets “next season.”
T-Mobile announced the details in a newsroom post this morning:
T-Mobile was selected by Vail Resorts as its exclusive nationwide wireless partner in a multi-year partnership focused on bringing 5G innovation to the slopes, trails and lodges at its 36 resorts across the country. T-Mobile will further expand and enhance its resort coverage and capacity, with already significantly more 5G coverage at Vail Resorts’ U.S. resort properties than AT&T and Verizon.
As a refresher, Vail owns some of the most popular mountain resorts in the US (plus partner resorts abroad). Stateside, those include Vail, Breckenridge, Crested Butte, Beaver Creek, Park City, Heavenly, Stowe, and many more.
The new deal makes T-Mobile the exclusive nationwide wireless partner for Vail Resorts with the goal of leveraging “the nation’s largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network to improve connectivity for resort employees and guests, explore 5G-powered solutions to enhance resort operations, and support sustainability goals.”
Speaking of sustainability, T-Mobile notes it will work with Vail Resorts to move toward “zero waste to landfill, zero impact to forests and habitat, and zero net emissions.” The Uncarrier highlights it hit 100% of total electricity use covered by renewable energy in 2021.
Mobile passes for 2023/2024
Vail Resort’s CMO Ryan Bennett shared a statement about the T-Mobile partnership and noted that the expanded 5G coverage would be key in “allowing us to explore more innovations like our Mobile Pass and Lift Ticket feature rolling out next season, as well as operate even more efficiently with better-connected teams.”

"The faba bean genome, which at 13 billion bases is more than four times the size of the human genome, has been sequenced for the first time and is published today (08 March 2023), in Nature. This is an extraordinary technical achievement and crucial to efforts to breed beans with optimum nutritional content and sustainability of production.
A consortium of scientists from Europe and Australia, led by the University of Reading (UK), Aarhus University (Denmark) and the University of Helsinki (Finland), worked together on this large scale sequencing project.
The project to fully decode the genome went on to test out its usefulness by searching for genes involved in seed size. The team also looked at the colour of the hilum -- the scar left when a bean detaches from the pod -- to see if they could find the genes that determine this distinctive feature.
Professor Donal O'Sullivan led the University of Reading team. He said: ""Having shown that we can quickly pinpoint genes controlling these visible seed traits, work is already underway to locate and identify precise genetic differences that control hidden seed characteristics that determine its nutritional value.""
""We want to produce beans that are higher in essential amino acids as well as lower in antinutrients, such as phytate, which binds micronutrients and reduces absorption. Having the genome sequence will accelerate this process considerably.""
At the University of Reading, the enhanced prospects for nutritional improvement feeds into a project to increase the amount of UK-grown pulses consumed, by incorporating faba bean flour into the ever-popular British white loaf. The ""Raising the Pulse"" project is part of the publicly-funded UKRI Transforming UK Food Systems initiative and will benefit from what is essentially now a genetic toolkit for breeding lines with beneficial traits.
Faba beans are naturally high in protein, fibre, and iron -- all nutrients that many people in the UK need more of. They grow well in the UK but are mostly fed to animals to produce meat and milk. At a time when plant-based diets are an attractive prospect for those wishing to look after their planet and their own health, it would make sense to go directly to the protein source: The humble faba bean.

"- Oil and gas giant Saudi Aramco announced a record $161 billion profit for 2022 on Sunday.
- The record profit comes amid all-time high oil and gas prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.
- Loosening of pandemic restrictions and increased travel also likely increased demand for oil and gas.
The Saudi Arabian Oil Company, the world's largest oil company and currently the second most valuable company in the world, reported record profits of over $161 billion for 2022.
Commonly referred to as Saudi Aramco, the oil and gas giant saw its profits increase nearly 50% from $110 billion in 2021 to a record $161.1 billion for 2022, the company announced Sunday. The company saw demand for its product, and global oil prices at large, spike in 2022 amid worldwide restrictions on imports of Russian oil and gas over the invasion of Ukraine.
""Aramco delivered record financial performance in 2022, as oil prices strengthened due to increased demand around the world,"" Aramco president and CEO Amin H. Nasser said in a statement. ""We also continued to focus on our long-term strategy, building both capacity and capability across the value chain with the aim of addressing energy security and sustainability.""
Aramco said its production of crude oil was about 11.5 million barrels per day across 2022, and it hopes to raise the level of production to 13 million barrels per day by 2027. Nasser said the company spent over $37 billion this year to increase its production capacity in 2022, and will continue to expand production of oil and gas, as well as ""new lower-carbon technologies with potential to achieve additional emission reductions.""
The company also said it plans to increase the dividend paid to shareholders, the largest of which is the Saudi government, to $19.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of about 4% from Q3.
In addition to the war in Ukraine, prices also were driven up by increased demand from China and other countries as they loosened pandemic restrictions and travel increased, and Saudi Arabia's oil pact with Russia and other countries to cap production at a certain level to keep prices high, according to NPR.
Other oil companies including ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell also recorded all-time high profits in 2022 as global oil and gas prices reached record highs last year. However, all of those earnings at $55.7 billion, $28 billion, and about $40 billion, respectively, were dwarfed by Aramco's $161 billion.
The massive earnings are not a welcome sight to everyone.
""It is shocking for a company to make a profit of more than $161 billion in a single year through the sale of fossil fuel – the single largest driver of the climate crisis,"" Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement Sunday. ""It is all the more shocking because this surplus was amassed during a global cost-of-living crisis and aided by the increase in energy prices resulting from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.""
Callamard also said she hopes Aramco uses its profits to help combat climate change, and not to finance or cover up human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia.
Aramco posted record high per-quarter earnings multiple times throughout 2022, previously reported by Insider. It also briefly dethroned Apple last year as the world's most valuable company."
"- On the campaign trail in 2020, Biden promised to ban all new oil drilling on federal land.
- He just violated that pledge by approving one of the largest-ever drilling projects on that land.
- Activists and many Democratic lawmakers are condemning his decision to approve the Alaska project.
President Joe Biden has made fighting climate change a central pillar of his presidency. He's promised — and the White House says he's delivered — more to protect the climate than any other US president.
But he just broke a key campaign pledge to stop all new oil drilling on federal land in a major way.
On Monday, the Biden administration officially approved one of the largest-ever drilling projects on federal land: the $8 billion ConocoPhillips Willow oil project, which is expected to produce more than 600 million barrels of crude oil over three decades in Alaska's North Slope. While the administration has previously been forced by the courts or Congress to approve some oil and gas leasing on federal land, Biden has rarely violated his campaign promise of ""no more drilling on federal lands, period"" without being compelled to do so.
Progressive lawmakers who've championed the president's pro-climate initiatives quickly condemned the Willow project approval on Monday, some citing his apparently discarded promise.
""This decision not only leaves an oil stain on the administration's climate accomplishments and the President's commitment not to permit new oil and gas drilling on federal land, but slows our progress in the fight for a more livable future and puts into harm's way the neighboring Native Village of Nuiqsut and the Arctic landscape,"" Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and leader on climate issues, said in a statement.
Climate activists panned the project, which will occur inside the 23-million acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.
""The Biden Administration and Interior Department promised to prioritize climate action, environmental justice and Indigenous sovereignty,"" Julian Brave NoiseCat, a writer and climate activist, told Insider in an email on Monday. ""The approval of the Willow Project contradicts all of those commitments.""
Jennie Stephens, a professor of sustainability science and policy at Northeastern University, told Insider the Biden administration ""is undermining its own climate justice goals"" and ""caving into pressure from corporate interests.""
""Fossil fuel phaseout is an urgent global priority – it is shameful that the United States is a laggard, rather than a leader, in this collective global challenge,"" she said.
A Biden administration official insisted that the government's hands were tied by leases granted to ConocoPhillips by prior administrations. The official noted that the administration is limiting drilling to three of the five proposed sites and that the company will give up 68,000 acres of existing leases.
""The company has a legal right to those leases,"" the official told Insider in a statement. ""The Department's options are limited when there are legal contracts in place. Courts would not allow a full denial of the project.""
Fossil fuel lobbyists and both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Alaska have long pushed the administration to back the lucrative project. Most Alaska Native communities also support it.
Likely in part to dampen the wave of backlash the administration expected to receive over the Willow approval, it also just announced sweeping environmental protections in the region. These include banning future oil and gas leasing in the US Arctic Ocean and protecting the majority – 13 million acres – of Alaska's Petroleum Reserve from future drilling.
Despite these protections, the Willow project is expected to come with significant environmental costs, aside from contributing to planet-warming emissions. The Interior Department's own assessment found concerning impacts on fresh water and the region's rare wildlife.
In a letter earlier this month, two dozen Democratic members of Congress urged Biden not to approve the project, calling it inconsistent with his ""commitments to combat the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.""
Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan called the Willow approval a ""disastrous decision"" that ""will have devastating consequences on our planet, frontline communities, and wildlife.""
Former Vice President Al Gore called it ""recklessly irresponsible"" and the Center for American Progress, a major Biden-aligned think tank, called it a ""carbon disaster"" that ""threatens to negate all of that promised progress on renewables.""
March 13, 2023: This story has been updated with comment from a Biden administration official."
"- The new Nokia G22, which was rolled out Feb. 25, is designed to be repaired at home.
- Its battery can be replaced in 5 minutes with a guitar pick, OO screwdriver, and sim card tray pin.
- The device comes in two colors, has a battery life of up to three days, and starts at £149.99.
HMD Global, the exclusive licensee of Nokia, wants us to change how we treat our smartphones.
People typically discard or sell their phones when the battery reaches the end of its lifespan or the screen starts to show its age. But the Finnish firm has developed the G22 in the hope that consumers will hold onto their handsets much longer.
The Nokia G22 has been designed to cut down on the steps and complexity involved in replacing a battery, screen, and charging port. For example, users can swap out the battery in around five minutes using an OO screwdriver, a sim card tray pin, and a guitar pick.
That's a dramatic change from the 90 minutes required to swap out the batteries in previous generations, according to Adam Ferguson, head of product marketing at HMD Global. He demonstrated a battery replacement live to journalists on a briefing call ahead of Mobile World Congress 2023.
Screens can be replaced with similar tools in less than 20 minutes, the company claimed. Customers can get their hands on replacements from repair partner iFixit, which also provides step-by-step guides.
The Nokia G22 starts at £149.99 (around $179), runs on Android 12, and has a battery life of up to three days. Available in meteor grey and lagoon blue, the device has a two-tone back that is made from recycled plastic.
Other features include OZO Playback for clearer sound and enhanced bass, and a 50MP camera with software enhancements for snapping pictures at night on the 6.52"" HD+ display.
Repairing a phone yourself typically voids the warranty, but Ferguson said the G22's will remain intact as long as users follow the self-repair guides provided by iFixit.
The repairability-by-design device follows a wider sustainability push. Circular, for example, is a subscription service that ensures Nokia phones are recycled or reused when a customer returns them. Just 32% of electronic waste in North America and Europe was recycled as of 2019.
In 2020, The European Commission announced plans to give consumers the right to repair their devices as part of its shift to a circular economy, but the publication of the proposal has been repeatedly delayed.
A bevy of companies offer modular phones that allow customers to change up their components as and when they want, not least Fairphone, which is made from recycled materials.
Fully DIY phones can be daunting, HMD Global's Ferguson said. The company opted for repairability on specific pain points so that it is still widely accessible, he added.
The Nokia G22 will be on display at MWC 2023 and rollout began Feb. 25. It will be available in the UK from March 6."
"- At Costco, little things often come in big packages.
- Though it might seem wasteful or excessive, the strategy serves several functions to keep costs low.
- The ideal Costco packaging dimensions allow the company to ship, stock, and sell more efficiently.
Within the super-sized world of a Costco wholesale warehouse, you're likely to find some tiny products displayed in jumbo packaging — like, surprisingly big.
Small, high-value items like gift cards, cosmetics, and more are dwarfed by clear plastic shells or brightly colored cardboard touting the value of the product.
While the extra material might strike some as excessive in a time of increasing eco-consciousness, packaging consultant Michael Carrier says it's actually a key piece of Costco's overall strategy to cut steps and waste from its supply chain and lower costs for shoppers.
Here's how it works:
Unlike most retailers that have to unpack boxes within boxes to stock their shelves, almost everything Costco sells — even half-ounce jars of eye cream — arrives to the store floor packed on a standard 40x48-inch pallet.
""That's what the whole process is designed to handle,"" Carrier said. ""Variability drives cost up.""
Once a pallet of merchandise is trundled out via forklift or lift-jack, its protective outer layer of cardboard or wrap is removed and the items are ready to sell with little to no additional handling required by employees.
Fitting stacks of products within the constraints of a pallet leads to some interesting optimization problems for brands to solve, which has led to another set of dimensions that are distinctly Costco.
""10 inches wide by 11 inches high,"" Carrier said. ""If you walk through health and beauty, you will see a lot of [items] in that kind of envelope, so that is the very ideal Costco size.""
With those dimensions, a supplier is able to pack a pallet with four ""shelves"" of its product that have four ""faces"" each, and stack those pallets two-high in a standard tractor trailer.
There are three key reasons a supplier would not send a tightly packed pallet of two-inch jars of a fancy cosmetic: it's less stable on display, it would contain too many units for Costco to sell quickly, and it would be too expensive to put one in every store.
""Having $20,000 in high-end face cream on the pallet on the floor isn't good business,"" Carrier said.
Big packaging lets suppliers ship a more manageable number of items to a Costco warehouse using the requisite pallet system.
Carrier's company, Berkley, even specializes in helping Costco suppliers break a single tightly-packed container of imported goods into as many as ten trucks loaded with dozens of presentable palletized displays.
Beyond the practical shipping considerations, the 10-inch cards have several additional advantages in the warehouse context, too: The extra marketing real estate helps tiny items stand out among other bulky offerings, while also reducing the risk of shoplifting that winds up leading to higher prices for customers.
And when it comes to sustainability, the company's packaging guidelines encourage suppliers to use recycled and recyclable materials, and to use the minimal amount of material possible without compromising product quality.
""When you really compare and think about the distribution, and all of the other packaging that you don't see for items that are sitting in Walmart and Target, it's actually a very efficient system,"" Carrier said.

"IRIS²: the EU’s response to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites project
The Renew Europe Group welcomes today’s plenary backing of the EU secure connectivity programme, renamed IRIS², an ambitious plan to deploy an EU-owned constellation of telecommunications satellites by 2027. It will secure the Union’s sovereignty and autonomy by guaranteeing fewer dependencies on third-country infrastructure, and the provision of secured telecommunications services for EU governments in critical scenarios where terrestrial networks are absent or disrupted, as observed, for instance, in the unfolding war in Ukraine. The new European satellites are also the EU's response to the Starlink satellite project, launched by Elon Musk, to provide internet services via a large network of satellites to those living in remote areas.
This future satellite constellation infrastructure will allow for synergies with private sector to develop commercial services and provide with high-speed internet and communication in all EU territory, including over isolated regions where terrestrial and broadband connection remain scarce.
Moreover, this Renew Europe-led programme will foster a completely new ecosystem of start-ups and SMEs, as well as the emergence of innovations and new services in the European space sector, and introduces for the first time strict sustainability criteria for heavy space activities, including launchers and satellites components.
The programme provides an ambitious budget (2.4 Billions), which will be complemented with contributions from Member States via the European Space Agency (ESA), and private contributions.
Renew Europe MEP Christophe Grudler (Mouvement Démocrate, France), Rapporteur on the EU secure connectivity programme, declared:
« With the war, Ukraine needed satellite telecommunications, but the EU didn’t have something to offer. Ukraine should not have to rely on the whims of Elon Musk to defend their people. With IRIS², the EU will have its own telecommunication constellation, able to offer secure communications to European governments and allies.
I’m proud that this constellation will also set a worldwide example in terms of sustainability, as we requested. Now it is time to build these new European satellites, and prepare them for launch!».
Note to editors
After the European Galileo satellites (the 'European GPS', used by more than 2 billion mobile devices worldwide), the Copernicus satellites (Earth observation), IRIS² will be the European Union's third major satellite programme."
"Native Trails Turns Reclaimed Wine-Making Materials Into Bath Vanities
Naomi Neilson founded Native Trails in 1996 and for more than 25 years, the sustainable kitchen and bath manufacturer has collaborated with hundreds of highly-skilled artisans in places such as Mexico, California, Vietnam, and Italy. Naomi is one of the few female leaders in the sustainable kitchen and bathroom industry, an industry that is heavily reliant on female consumers. In 2019, the company earned its B Corp Certification, joining a community of leaders helping to drive a global movement of people using business as a force for good. The company’s Vintner’s Collection is made from reclaimed wine-making materials.
Tell me a little bit about your childhood, education, and background in terms of how you first became interested in creativity, design, and sustainability.
I grew up around the restoration of Craftsman and Victorian homes – my dad was the engineer and my stepmother the artist, so they complemented each other perfectly in their home restoration endeavors. I was inspired not only by the inherent grace of the classic structures but also by how thoughtful design and attention to detail could completely transform those aged homes even beyond their former glory. The outdoors was also a big part of my childhood, and I’ve always had a great respect for nature. Resourcefulness evolved into a stronger sense of sustainability and personal responsibility to protect our natural world.
How would you describe the Vintner’s Collection?
Giving reclaimed materials a second life has been a longstanding practice – and passion – for Native Trails. Our Vintner’s Collection reuses wine-making materials from the heart of California’s wine country. We reincarnate straight, flat wine-stained oak staves that were used to flavor wine during the fermenting process into elegant bath vanities and mirrors with a unique history. The oak staves are soaking for months at a time, which enriches the exceptional character and grain of the oak, and then is further enhanced and protected with a low VOC finish. The collection is offered in several finishes including Blanc – a versatile, go-to white, Grigio – a cool gray wash, Noir – an opaque black, and Chardonnay – a well-loved light blonde finish. The Vintner’s Collection is a great example of how we work creatively to lessen our impact on the environment by giving new life to materials that already exist, while creating products with aesthetic appeal, function, and durability.
What inspired the Vintner’s Collection?
Native Trails is surrounded by wineries, and during our never-ending search for sustainable materials for our products, we realized that these oak staves were typically incinerated or dumped after use in the winemaking process. It is a lot of work to clean them up but we found that the unique character of the wood makes it worthwhile, and it is work that we feel good about doing.
What waste (and other) materials are you using, how did you select those particular materials and how do you source them?
We started working with recycled copper with some incredibly skilled artisans in Mexico about 25 years ago. Our first kitchen and bath products were our hammered copper sinks, which are still made from 100% recycled copper. The copper is sourced from all over central Mexico in the form of old wires, pipes, and other scrap. It is melted down, purified, and turned into brick-sized ingots, which are flattened into sheets and then hand hammered, bent, welded, and formed into beautiful sinks and bathtubs. We also repurpose fencing and barn wood when old structures are torn down, and we turn them into our Americana Collection of bath vanities and mirrors. With farmland all around us, we found that by restoring the high-quality wood after it had served its initial purpose for many decades, we could eliminate waste, highlight the beautifully textured wood, and really create something special. Each finished piece has a rich history and truly a soulful presence.
When did you first become interested in using waste as raw material and what motivated this decision?
I do think it goes back to seeing my parents restoring old homes – they were resourceful by choice, and they had huge respect for well-made antiques and found items. They taught me to appreciate both historical objects and structures as well as to be conscious about resources. After starting Native Trails in 1996, I realized how much material is consumed in the fabrication of most items and I started searching out alternative ways to build our products.
What processes do the materials have to undergo to become the finished product?
Depending upon the finish, we often lay the oak staves to dry and lighten under direct sunlight. We pass each piece of wood by hand through a sander to remove any encrusted sugars and residue from the winemaking process. The finishing process is also a multi-step endeavor – a combination of stains, paints, and waxes. The process for all products ends with a low VOC finish for enhancement and protection.
What happens to your products at the end of their life – can they go back into the circular economy?
We believe these products will live much longer than any of us. Possibly the most critical part of sustainability is building products to last, so that is our goal. However, all of our products are recyclable or even candidates for repurposing.
How did you feel the first time you saw the transformation from waste material to product/prototype?
Absolutely ecstatic. Actually, that never really changes. It’s like a new family member being born – we really are emotionally connected to everything we make.
How have people reacted to this collection?
Very positively. I think we all need as much human connection as we can get, and these pieces truly have soul. And though made from reclaimed wood, their styling is very transitional, so they can soften and enhance just about any design style.
How do you feel opinions towards waste as a raw material are changing?
When we began, it was not yet in vogue to reclaim materials for furniture or other goods, and that has changed dramatically. Today, people are much more appreciative of the aesthetic and environmental value of repurposing materials. Yet, we have a long way to go. There is so much more that can be done.
What do you think the future holds for waste as a raw material?
I think that as our planet’s resources diminish, it will have to be seen as a necessity. I see the upcoming generation as much more progressive about creating systems to capture and repurpose used materials – there is a lot of hope with the youth who are growing up increasingly environmentally aware."
"Today, HMD announced the 4G Nokia G22 with a key focus on repairability and sustainability. Let's explore that first, then we'll lay down the specs.
The Nokia G22 is for the smartphone owner that wants to hold onto his phone for the longest possible time. According to market research numbers the leading cause for people to change their phone is that it broke and that in most cases it was due to a broken display or a degraded battery, so HMD focused on making those as easy as to replace as possible.
A battery replacement of the Nokia G22 takes around 5 minutes and all the tools you need are the SIM ejector tool, a guitar pick and a screwdriver. Changing the display takes about 20 minutes, with a few extra tools. HMD partnered with iFixit to provide the tools, guide, and parts for you to replace the display, charging port or battery on the Nokia G22. Obviously, you can also take the G22 over to an authorized service center to do those repairs.
Nokia drastically reduced the steps needed to repair the G22 by removing the need to heat the back cover to remove it, and the need of alcohol to remove the battery.
Changing the battery and display is easier on the Nokia G22
The Nokia G22 has a back cover that uses 100% recycled plastic, while its packaging uses fully certified FSC Mix material.
As for the actual specs, the G22 has a 6.52-inch HD+ 90Hz display with Gorilla Glass 3. The front 8MP camera can perform face unlock even with a mask, and there's a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.
The Nokia G22 is powered by a Unisoc T606 chipset with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB storage. The Nokia G22 phone ships with Android 12, and HMD promises 2 OS upgrades and 3 years of security updates, so it should get to Android 14.
On the back, there's a triple camera system with a 50MP main camera, a 2MP macro unit, and a 2MP depth sensor.
The 5,050mAh battery takes 20W wired charging.
The Nokia G22 in Lagoon Blue and Meteor Grey
The Nokia G22 is available from today in Blue and Grey, starting at €179.
I have no idea why you got a red cross when environment sustainability is the future. Also, Fairphone don't do greenwashing, unlike Apple. They truly deliver fully user-replaceable repair-friendly phone since 2013. I can understand why Fairphone...
It's a good move towards a more sustainable future smartphones era but... I'd rather that Nokia invest in Fairphone and let the actual experts handle this initiative. Instead of putting out last gen specced products but with current gen pri...
Oh, piss off with that sustainability crap, all of a sudden you care about environment, better focus on making your phones better, better screens, cameras, audio..etc.

How America’s Dairy Farmers Are Making Cheese Greener (& Better) Than Ever
Sustainably made dairy makes it even easier to love cheese.
We’ve teamed up with Dairy Farmers of America and The Nerd Herd to shine a spotlight on the sustainability efforts of their family farm-owners, from farm to table to cheesemakers and beyond.
Between Buffalo and the Finger Lakes, there stands a 143-year-old tree surrounded by vast acres of neon-green pastures. The tree, one of the largest cottonwoods in the state of New York, was planted in 1880 by Frank Tillotson, who had just bought the land to raise dairy cows. He named his emergent business Cottonwood Farms after the tree—a business that is not only still thriving today, but innovating.
Cottonwood is one of many dairy farms focused on the way they farm in order to be a part of the solution in helping the planet. They’re family farm-owners of Dairy Farmers of America, a farmer-owned cooperative of nearly 11,000 family farm-owners across the U.S. working to produce environmentally-friendly milk, butter, cheese, ice cream, and other dairy products that don’t skimp on quality.
At Cottonwood, this commitment to sustainability is all about heritage. “We are only stewards of the land for a short time,” says Paul Tillotson, fourth-generation owner and Frank’s great-grandson. “It’s important to us that we’re leaving it in as good as or better condition than we got it in.” Cottonwood has been a certified organic farm since 2005, and they’re home to two of only three Solar Hybrid Diffused Augmented Wind Turbines—which use both solar and wind energy to power the farm—in the country. They also run bi-facial solar panels that reflect the sun’s rays in the summer and bounce light off of the snow in winter. They also grow feed for their 300 dairy cows who graze freely across 800 acres of smooth, rolling grassland.
The Tillotsons’ efforts are part of DFA’s work to reduce its carbon footprint to net zero or net negative, an effort in which they recently got a boost from a USDA grant to scale back methane emissions and increase soil carbon sequestration. This work is led by an aptly named Nerd Herd—a team of farmers, engineers, scientists, veterinarians, and many others who are working to make dairy more sustainable—and demonstrates that dairy is part of the solution to climate change.
“Each piece of our operation works together,” says Will Collier, DFA farmer-owner of T&K Dairy, in Snyder, Texas. “We grow feed for the cows and convert their waste into fertilizer for the crops. We use recycled water from our lagoon to flush and clean the concrete lanes in the robot barn, and then use the same water on our fields to help fertilize the crops.” Collier also maintains detailed records of any chemicals used on the land, monitors soil for nutrient levels, and keeps his cows healthy with lights and fans (and even back-scratchers) set up on energy-efficient timers.
Several DFA family farms now also use anaerobic digesters, which capture methane emitted by the cows’ waste and convert it into energy that can be used on the farm—or sold back to the grid. At Philip Verwey Farm in Hanford, California, the operation produces enough renewable energy to power the 4,600-acre farm and enable Philip and Brent Verwey to sell two-thirds of their energy back to the local utility cooperative.
And it isn’t all digesters—DFA is also committed to mitigating methane emissions by supporting trials for feed additives that may reduce cows’ methane output.
“The most untold story of our industry is what we’re doing as recyclers,” says AJ de Jager, DFA farmer-owner of Hunter Ridge Dairy in Ault, Colorado. “We bale old tires and recycle them as windbreaks for our feed lot. They absorb sunlight and create a higher thermal output and insulation.” Hunter Ridge also recycles their food scraps, water, and manure. At other operations, such as Brownhaven Farm in New Bremen, Ohio, sustainability initiatives take the form of crop rotation, management of water run-off, and wetland establishment. At Crimson Ridge Dairy in Watertown, Wisconsin, Shelly Grosenick keeps chickens to help with organic pest control, and makes soaps from her leftover raw milk. “Taking care of the land so that it takes care of us is important,” Grosenick says.
All of this creates dairy you can feel great about eating—and not just because it’s better for the planet. Members of the Nerd Herd ensure sustainability for the entire DFA ecosystem at every turn. From the veterinarians who ensure that the cows are happy and healthy to the engineers (affectionately referred to as the ""engi-nerds"") who help the family farms transition to renewable energy sources, this team of experts contributes to the feel-good factor of sustainably-made cheese.
“Being environmentally friendly is good for everyone,” says Brent Verwey. “It’s good for the public and it’s good for the industry.”
The farmer-owners of DFA produce the dairy that goes into a wide range of products, from butter and cream to cheddar and gouda—and their website, Half & Half, has plenty of recipes to help you transform all that sustainably-made dairy into comforting, delicious dishes. As the name suggests, their Five Cheese and Mushroom Slow Cooker Risotto employs a medley of cheeses like Asiago, fontina, and parmesan, while their Cauliflower Mac ‘n’ Cheese makes use of their planet-friendly milk, butter, and mozzarella. On the sweet side, we also love their creamy No-Bake Lemon Curd Cheesecake Bars.
Looking for a taste of classic American dairy? Look no further than the cheese curds in Food52’s Best Poutine. You can also share sustainable dairy at your next gathering with a Bloody Mary Cheese Plate and our Easiest, Cheesiest Skillet Dip, or take a cue from South Korean YouTube star Mangchi and whip up some Grilled Cheese Tteokbokki. The possibilities are always endless when it comes to cooking with good dairy, and even more so when it’s dairy you can feel good about eating.
Our friends at Dairy Farmers of America are committed to preserving farmers' legacies and nourishing a hungry world. They champion sustainability through innovation, community-building, and of course, plenty of delicious dairy. To learn more about DFA and sustainably-made dairy, visit their site.

"The Galaxy S23 Ultra is Samsung’s latest and greatest power-house smartphone with a more impressive chip, battery and camera than its predecessors. But do the improvements justify such a steep price?
At £1,249 ($1,199/A$1,949), which is £100 more than last year’s model, it is one of the most expensive non-folding smartphones available.
The S23 Ultra is the spitting image of its predecessor, an extremely solid and premium-feeling device and looks really good in cream, as pictured. It has the same super-bright and crisp screen, same aluminium frame and slightly less curved glass at the edges.
One of the S23 Ultra’s unrivalled features is the fan-favourite S Pen stylus, which was added to the S series last year and receives only minor changes. It is a similar story for the software, with the phone running Samsung’s One UI 5.1, which is based on Android 13. It is packed with useful features, including productivity tools for the S Pen, and more customisation options for the lockscreen.
The new phone will receive at least five years of software updates from release, including four major Android version updates and monthly security patches. Samsung has dramatically improved the speed and availability of updates for older devices over the past couple of years, which means most of its top line of phones made in the past few years are already running One UI 5.1.
Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 now worldwide
Unusually for Samsung, all Galaxy S23 models use the same top Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip from Qualcomm regardless of where they are sold. In the past, most regions, including the UK and Europe, used Samsung’s own slightly weaker chips, while the US used Qualcomm’s.
The new chip is therefore a bigger deal to consumers in Europe, not only boosting general and gaming performance by up to 35% but running much more efficiently, staying cooler under heavy workloads and extending battery life considerably.
The S23 Ultra lasts more than 52 hours between charges, making it one of the longest-lasting smartphones I’ve tested alongside Apple’s iPhone 14 Plus. That was with the screen actively used for more than six hours and at least an hour spent on 5G a day, the rest of the time on wifi. Heavy gaming sessions reduced the battery life, but the phone survived even the heaviest days of general usage with about 30% left in the tank.
I have no doubt almost three-day battery life is possible with more frugal use. Turning off the always-on display adds roughly 10% to the battery life.

Sustainability
Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.
The phone is generally repairable. Screen repairs cost about £260, while the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. Samsung offers a self-repair programme in the US, but not in the EU or UK. The phone scores up to 6 out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability ranking.
It contains recycled material in 12 components – double last year’s number – including aluminium, glass and plastic. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products.
Camera
There are four cameras on the back of the phone and a good 12-megapixel selfie camera at the top of the screen.
As with the previous two Ultra generations, the four-camera array includes 3x and 10x optical zoom telephoto 10MP modules, which are excellent and allow a far greater range of zoom than any rival. Images up to 30x zoom look as good as most other phones manage at less than 10x. The 12MP ultrawide produces excellent landscape and architecture shots and is used for Samsung’s very good macrophotography mode when up close.
New for this year is a 200MP main camera, which uses the first of a new generation of sensors with just under double the pixel count of previous models. By default it uses the data from all the pixels to increase captured light and detail, producing 12MP images that are some of the very best available across a range of light levels. The phone can also shoot at 50MP or the full 200MP, the latter producing huge image files with an amazing amount of detail in bright light. They lack the dynamic range of 12MP shots, however, as they lose some of the advanced processing.
Low-light mode is slightly better overall and produces generally well exposed images, though is needed less as the camera gathers more light to start with. The camera app is packed with advanced and fun features, including a full RAW shooting experience for those looking to do their own editing and the most capable video on Android.
Samsung’s portrait photography, particularly at its 3x zoom, is class-leading on natural look and fine details such as flyaway hairs.
Compared with the S21 and S22 Ultra from the last two years, the S23 Ultra offers only incremental upgrades across the entire camera system. But that has kept it the most capable camera on any smartphone available, and is about the only one I would consider to be able to replace the utility of a dSLR or equivalent with its full range of optical zoom.
Price
The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra costs from £1,249 ($1,199.99/A$1,949) with 256GB of storage.
For comparison, the Galaxy S23 costs £849, the S23+ costs £1,049, the Z Fold 4 costs £1,649, the Google Pixel 7 Pro costs £749 and the iPhone 14 Pro costs £1,099.
Verdict
If ever there was a phone worthy of the “ultra” moniker, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is it.
The phone is unrivalled in size, power, capability and battery life on Android, while its camera is more capable than any other on the market. It is very much overkill for most, but for those who would like the ability to do more or less anything with a phone, the S23 Ultra has the goods.
It is full of little improvements to almost every aspect. However, it only builds on big leaps made two years ago and is overshadowed by more innovative folding devices. Its very high price makes it poor value next to the Google Pixel 7 Pro, which cannot match the Samsung on every element but comes close enough for £400-£500 less.
It is without doubt the best Android phone available. Whether that’s enough to be a hit at this price any more, I’m not sure.
Pros: very big 120Hz screen, brilliantly capable camera with 3x and 10x optical zoom, good software with five years support, faster fingerprint scanner, S Pen stylus, top performance, very long battery life, contains recycled materials.
Cons: huge, heavy, extremely expensive, S Pen may be superfluous feature for many."

"Oppo’s first folding flip phone to be sold outside its Chinese home market is the Find N2 Flip, an Android clamshell aimed squarely at challenging Samsung’s popular Z Flip 4.
The next-gen flipper costs £849, undercutting Samsung by £50, and uses a different type of hinge that aims to help solve one of the most obvious flaws with folding phones: the crease in the middle of the screen.
The metal and glass form is immediately familiar, with a bright 6.8in screen that looks like a regular phone when open. The flexible OLED screen still folds in half, but Oppo’s hinge design creates a “water drop” shape at its centre instead of an even loop.
That allows the radius of the fold not to be too tight, creating less of a crease in the surface of the display when unfolded. That’s not to say there is no visible depression that cuts across the screen, but it is shallower and less pronounced than other folding phones.
The N2 Flip’s hinge feels solid when fully open, and it closes with a satisfying snap, but it offers less resistance and has a lot more play than Samsung’s folding phones. It can hold the screen open between 45 and 110 degrees, but wobbles while doing it.
The phone is only splash-resistant, not submersible, as is the industry standard. Oppo offers no formal dust-resistance rating for the N2 Flip, but has built multiple protections from dust into the back of the hinge. The phone is also rated to last more than 400,000 folds, which is more than 100 openings and closings every day for 10 years.
Specifications
Main screen: 6.8in FHD+ 120Hz AMOLED (403ppi)
Cover screen: 3.3in AMOLED (250ppi)
Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 9000+
RAM: 8GB
Storage: 256GB
Operating system: ColorOS 13 based on Android 13
Camera: 50MP+8MP rear, 32MP front
Connectivity: 5G, nano sim + esim, wifi6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3 and GNSS
Water resistance: IPX4 splash
Folded dimensions: 85.5 x 75.2 x 16mm
Unfolded dimensions: 166.2 x 75.2 x 7.5mm
Weight: 191g
Good battery and reasonable performance
Unusually for an Android phone of this price, the N2 Flip has a MediaTek Dimensity 9000+ chip, rather than one from Qualcomm. On paper, it is slower than the chips in rivals from the last two years, but on the whole it performed well, felt snappy and carried out tasks just fine, with a little stutter here and there in some graphically intensive games.
Battery life is very good for a folding phone, generally lasting up to about two days between charges when used mostly on wifi with the main screen on for about five hours plus a couple of hours used on 5G while out and about. Longer stretches on 5G in congested areas shortened battery life by about half a day, but that is still far longer than the Samsung Z Flip 4, which only lasts 31 hours under similar conditions.
Sustainability
Oppo rates the batteries to maintain at least 80% of original capacity for at least 800 full charge cycles.
The phone is generally repairable by Oppo in the UK, with a replacement battery costing £72. The company operates a trade-in scheme and publishes yearly sustainability reports, but not for individual products. The Find N2 Flip does not include recycled materials.
ColorOS 13
Oppo’s ColorOS is a heavily customised version of Android 13, with a colourful design and features that are more familiar in Asia than is the case with most of the Android phones sold in the west.
It works fine, but lacks polish. Small errors are visible across the whole interface, such as asking for a “password” on the lockscreen when it is actually requesting a passcode with the number pad, and what appear to be slightly off translations of Chinese into English everywhere. These are niggles, but they shouldn’t exist in a phone of this price from a manufacturer as big as Oppo.
More annoyingly, you can’t quickly open the camera with a double press of the power button like you can on western Android phones, including the Oppo sub-brand OnePlus; you have to resort to double-pressing one of the volume buttons, which doesn’t work if the screen is on or if music is playing.
While the cover screen generally works fine, the display is almost always upside down when you fold the phone or pick it up from a desk, requiring a second or so to rotate itself when you pick it up.
Oppo will provide four years of Android updates and five years of security updates from release, similar to Samsung’s and Google’s policies but lagging Apple’s six-plus years of support.
Camera
The N2 Flip has a main 50-megapixel and 8MP ultrawide camera on the outside and a 32MP camera on the inside screen.
The main camera is pretty good, shooting generally well-detailed and properly exposed images in good and medium light, but photos can look a bit grey in dimmer settings. Low-light performance is reasonable, as are portrait shots, but there’s no macrophotography mode available.
The ultrawide camera is poor, however, producing dark, grey shots – something I would use only in bright conditions.
The 32MP selfie camera is pretty good as these things go, but you also have the option of shooting using the main camera with the phone closed, which works well.
Overall, the cameras on the N2 Flip are nothing to write home about, lagging most high-end competitors at this price but perfectly fine for general snaps.
Price
The Oppo Find N2 Flip costs £849 and will ship on 2 March in black or purple.
For comparison, Samsung’s Z Flip 4 costs £899, the Oppo Find X5 Pro costs £799, and the OnePlus 11 costs £729.
Verdict
The Oppo Find N2 Flip has proven that good folding phones aren’t just the domain of the market leader Samsung and can be made for closer to mainstream prices.
The N2 Flip excels at putting a large screen into your pocket in a compact folding package. It looks and feels the part, keeping all the novelty of the clamshell phone, but improving on previous designs, with its water-drop hinge reducing the crease in the screen. It lasts far longer than other folding flip phones on battery and feels snappy in day-to-day usage.
The big cover screen on the outside is handy, but feels under-utilised, with limits on what you can do with it. The general software needs polishing for this premium price, too. The camera is fine, but not up to the same standard as you would find on similarly priced phones. There is certainly room for improvement.
Oppo rates the screen and hinge for 400,000 folds, which should mean it lasts for the life of the phone. But as this is the company’s first folding device to launch outside China, it doesn’t yet have the same track record of durability that Samsung has spent the last four years working on.
I’m cautiously optimistic, but this is still new technology, and more fragile than a traditional phone that needs treating with care. Buying insurance might be wise.
Pros: a great large screen that folds in half, water-drop hinge decreases crease visibility, large cover screen, good battery life, dual-nano sim and esim, undercuts competitors on price.
Cons: less durable than a regular phone, only splash-resistant, no dust-resistance rating, average cameras and no optical zoom, software needs polish, not the fastest phone."
"Demand for rare-earth elements is growing and may reach 315,000 tons by 2030. Meanwhile, more than 40 million tons of e-waste—trashed computers, cell phones, and other electronics—is generated each year. Some of that waste contains the same valuable elements that face rising demand.
Over the years, several notable methods have been suggested for recovering spent or waste-based rare-earth elements, such as urban mining or nano-filtration systems in streams. One persistent idea is to use microorganisms such as bacteria to “bioabsorb” the desired substances—a passive biological process in which the organisms bind and remove the substances from an aqueous solution. The technology hasn't yet been rolled out at an industrial level, but some researchers suggest that their most recent findings represent a big step forward.
In a recent paper, Thomas Brück, a professor at the Technical University of Munich who studies synthetic biotechnology and sustainability, and his colleagues describe identifying 12 exotic cyanobacterial species that are particularly good at absorbing rare-earth elements. These species could be used to reclaim desirable elements, while also cleaning up the land and the water. “[I]t's not something we predicted in any way,” Brück told Ars.
The unusual suspects
The research was six years in the making. The team began screening a variety of algae and bacterial species, but none of them absorbed rare-earth elements particularly well. So, they turned their attention to a dozen species of cyanobacteria. Some came from environments that were particularly inhospitable to most forms of life. For instance, Lake Natron, which is both unusually alkaline, with a pH at around 10, and sees temperatures that can reach 60º C (or 140º F). According to Brück, it’s unclear whether how these organisms evolved to thrive in these environments contributed to their ability to gobble up rare-earth elements.
Often, the species came from incredibly specialized habitats like arid desert soils in Namibia, the alkaline Lake Natron in Chad, rock crevices in South Africa, or polluted brooks in Switzerland. These were “really unique, extreme environments,” Brück said.
Most of these bacteria had not been assessed for their potential for bioremediation before. In the lab, the teams subjected cultures of the different species to aqueous solutions containing the rare-earth elements lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium, then checked to see how well they held the elements to their surface using infrared spectroscopy.
One previously uncharacterized species of Nostoc cyanobacteria performed the best. Its bioabsorption of the four rare-earth elements from the solutions pulled in between 84.2 and 91.5 mg of metal per gram of biomass. The worst performing was Scytonema hyalinum at 15.5 to 21.2 mg per gram of biomass. The paper noted, however, that how well each candidate performed depended on acidity and that the processes were more efficient when there were no other metals in the solution to compete with the targeted rare-earth element.
The dirty, er, clean dozen
It’s also possible, and relatively easy, to get the desired rare-earth elements back out of the biomass. It would simply be a matter of altering the solution’s pH—using an acid or something like lye—or salinity. The elements would functionally just “wash” out from the biomass. Returning the solution back to its previous state would then allow the process to start over again, meaning the cyanobacteria cultures could be reusable.
“It's not a one-shot deal where at the end of the binding you have to burn the biomass to recover your metals,” Brück said.
Researchers or industrial actors could create bioreactors—specialized vessels containing microbial biomass—for several future uses. For one, they could be used to collect rare-earth elements from e-waste dumps, though this would require turning the e-waste into a form that is usable by the microorganisms. This would provide environmental benefits by removing waste from these areas and potentially creating jobs in parts of the world to where e-waste is regularly shipped from the Global North, locations like Nigeria, Ghana, and Tanzania. Next, Brück added, they could be used to clean out and recover these elements from industrial runoff, such as from mining or from the chemical industry.
According to Brück, the research could represent a big step forward. From this point, the researchers hope to scale up significantly—something that has yet to happen in the field. They plan to work with partners in various industries to do so, although that’s a tricky prospect given that it’s a fairly specialized process: It’s not like growing corn in agriculture, nor is it like traditional metal-refining methods. All the same, the researchers are hopeful about the results.
“I think we are at a step right now where we can say, ‘Hey, we can make this work,’” Brück said.

"Nokia unveils angular logo as part of its first rebrand in 45 years
In a move to present itself as a technology brand encompassing more than just mobile devices, Nokia has rebranded and refreshed its logo with a simplified and angular design.
The updated logo was developed with consulting firm Lippincott as part of Nokia's wider rebranding strategy to reflect itself as ""a B2B technology innovation leader realising the potential of digital in every industry"".
The blocky design of the previous logo, which was designed in 1979, was simplified to make it more minimalist and angular with slender characters.
The recognisable deep, subdued Nokia blue hue was updated to a brighter shade.
The diagonal strokes of the K in the previous logo were kept in an arrowhead shape in the redesign, but the upright stem of the letter was removed.
Strokes from the letters N and A were also removed to create an abstract, modernised appearance. The O in the logo also changed from a rounded square to a circular shape.
""The company's new logo is emblematic of an energised, dynamic and modern Nokia, demonstrating its values and purpose,"" said the brand.
""The new brand asserts the value Nokia brings in networking expertise, technology leadership, pioneering innovation and collaborative partnership,"" Nokia continued.
""It has been designed as a symbol of collaboration, which Nokia believes to be critical for realising the exponential potential of networks, unlocking gains in sustainability, productivity, and accessibility.""

"NTT and Cisco said they will jointly build and bring to market technology and managed services that will enable enterprise customers to deploy private 5G.
The collaboration will accelerate edge connectivity through NTT’s Managed Private 5G solution, combined with Intel hardware. This will enable Cisco and NTT customers to easily integrate private 5G into their pre-existing LAN/WAN/cloud infrastructure.
These mega-players are looking to meet the needs of the increasing number of enterprises that are investing in network modernization for security, productivity, sustainability and other corporate objectives. Many are turning to private 5G.
Cisco and NTT are working together to assist enterprise customers in accelerating digital transformation with 5G and Wi-Fi across IT and OT operations, according to Masum Mir, senior vice president and general manager for provider mobility at Cisco Networking.
Cloud-managed private 5G will easily enable integration with customers’ enterprise network fabrics, and “provide a common policy and zero trust security architecture,” Mir said in a statement accompanying the joint announcement. The goal is to minimize technical, financial and operational risks associated with managing 5G networks, he said.
Private 5G: Reporting for action
“Private 5G is emerging as a solution for enterprises that seek granular deployment, higher speed and better security capabilities than Wi-Fi and 4G LTE may offer,” Parm Sandhu, vice president, enterprise 5G products and services, NTT, told VentureBeat. “Its reduced latency is thought to better enable data-intensive Industry 4.0 and other applications such as push-to-talk ‘walkie-talkie’ communications, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), always-connected PCs (for digital frontline workers), machine vision (e.g. predictive maintenance, PPE detection) and more,” Despite some initial slow uptake, 5G of the private variety is garnering momentum.
According to IDC, the global private 5G market is expected to exceed $8 billion by 2026, with a compound annual growth rate of 35.7% from 2022. Further indicating this demand is NTT’s Global Network Report, which revealed that 70% of C-level executives say their current network is negatively affecting their business, and that 86% plan to adopt private 5G to drive network modernization. Such data drives the interest of NTT, Cisco and others.
Computer vision, predictive analytics among the targets
Cisco and NTT have already begun coordinating on several customer deployments. The two companies are planning to power computer vision for product quality analysis, predictive analytics for manufacturing equipment functionality and maintenance, and autonomous vehicles for moving products on the factory floor, using NTT’s IoT-connected solutions.
NTT claims to have the world’s first fully managed enterprise private 5G platform. The company has multi-year agreements with innovative brands such as Celona, VMware, Albemarle, ServiceNow, Schneider Electric and BMW Innovation Hub.
NTT has also aided the Frankfurt Airport in building Europe’s largest private 5G network, and the City of Las Vegas in deploying the largest private 5G network in the U.S.
“We’re confident that we’ll be well positioned to expand our ecosystem that will enable enterprise private 5G networks to scale and ultimately help companies achieve better business outcomes across industries,” Sandhu said.
Cisco, meanwhile, was active in 5G news beyond its agreement with NTT. Much of that news coincided with this week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. The company launched Meraki 5G gateways with T-Mobile; gained a deal with Vtal to build a multi-tenant 5G network in Brazil; and said it is collaborating with Intel to build “global 5G innovation centers” to test 5G applications and use cases.

"Liquor industry leader Ann Mukherjee makes bold moves to fulfill her passionate belief in return on responsibility.
“It’s not enough to be responsible. You have to get a return on it,” says Mukherjee, the 57-year-old chairwoman and CEO of Pernod Ricard North America, the largest operation at the world’s second biggest producer of wine and spirits. It makes Absolut vodka, Malibu rum, Jameson Irish whiskey, and Beefeater gin, among others. “I experienced personal traumas caused by others’ irresponsible drinking. That’s why my responsibility is to lend my voice and humanize issues,” she says.
Mukherjee was born in India, and raised in the U.S. An intoxicated adolescent boy sexually assaulted her at age four. A drunk driver killed her mother when she was a teenager. She held marketing management roles at several consumer product makers before surprising friends and family by joining the booze business.
Now she’s the first woman, person of color, and industry outsider to lead Pernod Ricard’s North American unit, which excludes Mexico. Shortly after her December 2019 arrival at the company, Mukherjee launched an Absolut Vodka campaign targeting sexual consent, and painted “sex responsibly” on her fingernails.
Next up, she will expand a Dallas pilot project that combats binge drinking and impaired driving. The “Safe Night” program, which Pernod cosponsors, hopes to soon add another major U.S. city. “We want to take this nationwide,” she says. A self-proclaimed “acceleration queen,” Mukherjee says she also aims to speed Pernod Ricard’s U.S. growth “to try to make us number one in the world.”
TIME recently spoke with Mukherjee about her employer’s other efforts to prevent drunk driving, the appetizing outlook for ready-to-drink cocktails, “war gaming” product launches, and why she yearns to own a restaurant.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
How does return on responsibility improve returns for your investors? Do you avoid taking a public stance on certain controversial issues because your position might hurt Pernod Ricard?
Consumers have a higher standard around brands they trust. They expect those brands to be walking the talk. Return on responsibility is what consumers expect of us. It actually drives return on investment. Making it part of your DNA not only future-proofs your business, it also creates the loyalty you need.
We only go after those issues that drive value, our company values, and our purpose of conviviality. Conviviality is about unlocking this magic of human connections. When somebody gets promoted, you’re celebrating over two flutes of champagne. We stay away if [an issue] isn’t about unlocking that magic.
Employees have asked me to speak against gun violence, a very important issue, but not our mission. So I am not going to [do so].
Why should executives speak out about issues related to their business? After all, most Americans want companies to stay out of social and political issues, some surveys find.
Every company needs to define their value creation model. You’re giving people something to buy into [because] you are a brand standing for timeless values. If sustainability issues are not about how you create value, don’t talk about them. Taking on topics du jour is another form of greenwashing. [Saying] you care about sustainability “because we’re supposed to’’ is not good enough. At Pernod Ricard, we talk about sustainability because nothing we make happens without agriculture. We won’t have a business if we don’t care about our farmers [or] don’t understand water conservation.
The Dallas pilot project epitomizes your return on responsibility commitment by training restaurants and bars to assist customers who drink too much. Given your horrific experiences involving alcohol abusers, why didn’t you initially launch a nationwide campaign against drunk driving?
The project’s approach had never been done before so we wanted to pilot it to make sure we got the right model [before] we start rounding it out to every city. Nationally, we do other things around responsible drinking. You attack it through helping the hospitality industry, education, and legislation. We worked very hard with Responsibility.org on a [relevant] piece of legislation in President Biden’s infrastructure package.
The package the president signed into law contains a provision that any car manufactured in the United States must soon be capable of preventing a drunk driver from operating the vehicle. I got pretty emotional the day that law got signed. I posted a picture of my mom to my family and told them how the provision will reduce drunk driving. It was a way to give her death some meaning.
The ready-to-drink cocktail market is flourishing. How much U.S. revenue might Pernod Ricard get from such cocktails five years from now?
I can’t give any forward-looking numbers, but it is a part of our growth equation. The U.S. market for ready-to-drink cocktails is expected to grow at a rapid pace. People looking for convenience [also] want brands and cocktails they know and trust. So Malibu making a ready-to-drink piña colada makes sense. Absolut making an espresso martini ready to drink makes sense.
It’s important enough for us that we are now investing capital behind it. We’ve installed [our first] ready-to-drink canning line in our Fort Smith, Ark., facility. That $22 million investment is expandable so as that business gets bigger, we have the ability to grow with it.
While chief marketing officer of Frito-Lay North America, you helped introduce biodegradable bags for its Sun Chips. But due to their loud crackling sounds, the bags got withdrawn. What key leadership lesson did that noisy flop teach you?
At that time, the company wanted to make bold statements. While [the bag] did not work, employees said, “Wow, we were willing to take a risk for what we believed in.” But [being] enamored by the technology clouded our better business judgment. Passion, if not done objectively, sometimes is not the smartest thing to do. I learned to have a war game plan ready to go if something goes wrong.
How do you use war gaming to lead Pernod Ricard North America effectively?
We war game to be ready. There could be possible problems involving innovation launches, new marketing campaigns or new technology. And even if it’s a success, what were the lessons learned?
A great example is Jameson Orange, the first real flavored whiskey launched under the Jameson franchise. It was probably the biggest [U.S.] innovation launch the industry saw last year. We war gamed everything. What did this teach us? You got to make sure your innovation is on the shelf before you do all that [promotional] display stuff. It was 100% against industry norms. We’re very excited about the results. We now launch innovation based on learnings around how consumers shop.
You often use nail polish to broadcast your views about hot topics. You painted Black Lives Matter or BLM on your fingernails after George Floyd’s murder in 2020. And you put a Ukrainian flag on your nails following Russia’s invasion last year. What message are you sending to your coworkers?
That it’s OK to be vulnerable. And it’s a way for me to use something illustratively to say, “I care. You matter.’’
You try to unleash gifts that colleagues don’t know they have, so they feel they can do the impossible. What impossible goal have you achieved?
Sitting in the chair I’m in today. I’ve been told, “You should be a homeless drug addict,’’ [because of] my story. I feel very privileged that people believe I can create positive change. Most people can achieve anything they want if they can get out of their own way. I try to get people out of their own way and give them inspiration and hope.
Not long ago, you said you were still trying to decide what you want to be when you grow up. Are you interested in becoming CEO of a publicly held company someday?
Why wouldn’t I be? That’s absolutely in the mix. I get [recruiter] calls. And what a training ground I’m in now! But I’m very happy where I am. I came [to Pernod Ricard] because I wanted to accomplish something from a business and responsibility perspective. Working for a company you believe in doesn’t come around every day.
I would [also] love to open my own restaurant and be the Stanley Tucci of India. Cooking is how I get rid of stress. I read cookbooks like novels. I love fusion cooking, bringing different cuisines together, and understanding culture through food. We [recently took] a three-week food extravaganza tour in Vietnam. I’ve got lots of dreams. Who knows what I’ll end up doing?

"Disentangling global market drivers for cephalopods to foster transformations towards sustainable seafood systems
A new study from the University of Santiago de Compostela utilizes the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) to identify how international policy can increase the sustainability of the global cephalopod food system.
Food systems can have a detrimental impact on biodiversity loss, therefore reversing biodiversity loss depends on us transforming the methods of food production to achieve more sustainable food systems. Most current research has focused on food systems within the agricultural sector, however a new paper by the University of Santiago de Compostela, published in People and Nature, highlights the criticality of the seafood sector.
Cephalopods such as cuttlefish, octopus and squids provide health benefits to nature and people. They act as vital predators within marine ecosystems, while also being a nutritionally important seafood source that can support human food security. However, the link between ecosystems that cephalopods inhabit, food system policies, and human well-being, have previously never been studied.
Across the world, cephalopod fisheries have rapidly expanded over the past 50 years, and have moved into new fishing areas to match the growing market demand. However, the availability and abundance of cephalopods fluctuates due to natural reasons, as well as environmental effects like climate change.
Market preferences for particular cephalopods also impacts on food systems in a way that is poorly understood. This further increases the uncertainty around the sustainability of cephalopod fisheries. The new study addresses the need to better understand the cephalopod food system by exploring the connections between nature's contributions to people (ecosystem services), food system policies and human well-being.
The team conducted a global literature review, analyzing scientific studies related to market drivers that influence three market sectors of the cephalopod food system: catch, trade and consumption. Key findings revealed nine dynamic traits and 29 ""cephalopod market drivers"" within the cephalopod food system. These link the ecosystems that cephalopods inhabit, to the catch, trade and consumption of cephalopod products.
The researchers also identified important value chain actors; supply chain components; cultural, provisioning and supporting services provided by cephalopods (like material and non-material indicators of human well-being) and key policies and market interventions affecting cephalopod food system dynamics.
The IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) framework is a socio-ecological model of the complex interactions between human society and the natural world. It contains six interlinked elements: nature's contributions to people, anthropogenic assets, institutions, governance (and other indirect drivers of change), direct drivers of change and good quality of life.
The authors were able to link each of the nine food system traits identified in the study to a corresponding interlinked element of the IPBES. With the aim of driving the necessary change towards sustainable food systems in the future, the team were able to understand the links between market demand, policies and processes in regards to cephalopods and the associated impacts on their populations and ecosystems.
As a result, the authors created a novel market-based version is the IPBES called the ""Cephalopod Food System Framework."" It provides a simplified overview of the dynamics in cephalopod food systems by depicting the relationships between cephalopod ecosystem services, fisheries (and other institutions), anthropogenic assets, nature's contribution to people and good quality of life.
All of these factors are linked to the political realms of commerce and sustainable food systems through a proposed policy landscape. The authors recommend that the policy landscape should integrate nationals and regional pathways towards the creation of resilient, equitable, sustainable and inclusive food systems. They also highlight the need to respect cultural traditions from the most vulnerable and local coastal communities.
The study provides an important contribution for the global diagnosis of opportunities and constraints regarding the role of cephalopods in transformations towards a more diversified and resilient seafood production system.
This landscape is highly complex in terms of interactions between sectors involved, requiring integration and collaboration at various geographical, societal and temporal points. Therefore the paper highlights four key factors (relating to cephalopods) that can support the transitions towards food security: the value of new aquatic food species, food safety and authenticity systems, place-based innovations and finally, empowerment of communities and consumer behavior—motivations for better health and environmental sustainability.
The authors conclude that it is vital that food systems policies should match ambitions relating to biodiversity conservation such as the Convention of Biological Diversity. Applying the IPBES framework and its features in a novel setting can lead the way for potential adaptations to understand more socio-ecological systems.

"“We had our chance to make incremental changes, but that time is over. Only a root-and-branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate disaster,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The data is clear: Global emissions are going up. Voluntary pledges to prevent new fossil fuel projects and curb devastating practices such as mass deforestation are failing to prevent the destruction of nature and rising global inequality.
Inaction is not an option. Businesses committed to being on the right side of history must advocate for policies, regulations, and laws to achieve economy-wide systemic change at the pace and scale required to achieve climate targets. This means working on their own transformational approaches as well as joining forces with others to create the critical mass needed for wide-scale change.
Based on our cross-organizational work at three B Corps — Natura & Co (Charmian), Patagonia (Beth), and Ecosia (Sophie) — we’ve identified five critical elements for advocacy strategies that will help businesses use their power and influence to push for the system change required to meet climate targets.
Advocating for System Change
Although the business community has made progress toward climate goals since the 2015 Paris Agreement, fewer than one-fifth of net-zero targets set by national and subnational governments and only a third of the largest public corporations with net-zero targets actually meet science-aligned criteria. Further, anti-climate lobbying has had a disastrous effect on the planet and cost years in meaningful action.
The nonprofit B Lab UK breaks system change down into two parts:
- Regulatory change. Companies can work with policymakers, trade associations, and NGOs to shape changes in the law. For example, prior to the UN General Assembly in 2022, the Climate Champions Team worked with experts from across the voluntary, standards, and regulatory landscape to publish the Pivot Point report, which proposed a range of policy interventions that would build on the global campaigns Race to Zero and Race to Resilience.
- Culture change. Even with the right policies in place, we know that culture needs to change in order for them to be effective. Businesses can engage in culture change using tools including media and advertising to promote and amplify new norms, bring awareness to key issues, educate consumers on why policy change is important, and show them how to engage with others to make change happen. For example, the recent move toward repairing outdoor gear rather than replacing it — initiated in the 1970s by Patagonia but now common among outdoor manufacturers and retailers — is encouraging consumers to think about their consumption habits.
In thinking about the regulatory and cultural elements of system change, avoid reducing advocacy to just its outward-facing corporate initiatives and programs. Internal advocacy programming plays a critical role in mobilizing people within the business, inspiring a desire in workers to engage and enabling them to take action.
Recent research from political scientist Erica Chenoweth shows just how much impact people “on the inside” can have when it comes to driving changes at a government level. “The 3.5% rule,” which Chenoweth developed in 2012, provided evidence to show that governments are generally unable to withstand the force of 3.5% of the population engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience. A decade on, their revisiting of that research shows the importance of securing support from powerbrokers from institutions that benefit from the status quo, such as corporations and shareholders.
Designing an Advocacy Strategy
GlobeScan’s 2022 Sustainability Leaders Survey compiled views of more than 700 sustainability experts around the world and found that advocacy is increasingly seen as a leadership practice in business. Now is the time for business leaders to create advocacy strategies for their companies.
A comprehensive, meaningful advocacy strategy should be anchored by a core set of principles. Through our cross-organizational work, we’ve identified these 5 As of advocacy to serve as a foundation:
Authenticity
Center your advocacy around your company’s story, including where, why, and how it started, and what problem it was trying to solve. Transparency is critical — even if the story isn’t always perfect. For example, Patagonia’s founder, Yvon Chouinard, started the business based on his love of the mountains. Over time, the proximity to nature helped affirm Patagonia’s commitment to protecting our “home planet.”
Not every business has purpose embedded into its history in this way — and that’s OK. It isn’t a prerequisite, but what is required is transparency in order to build trust and engage meaningfully in advocacy work focused on forward-looking system change. Take for example Interface, a carpet tile company that was founded in 1973 by Ray Anderson. In 1994, Anderson had an “epiphany” and began the company’s Mission Zero initiative, with the goal of eliminating Interface’s negative impact on the environment by 2020. The company celebrated the achievement of that goal in 2019 and continues to roll out climate-change initiatives, including by engaging other businesses.
Ambition
Build on science-based targets to set stretch goals rather than being limited by what feels possible. For example, Ecosia became one of the world’s largest reforestation movements by using 100% of its profits for climate action. On top of that, Ecosia’s green search engine runs on 200% renewable energy.
Agency
Engage employees to take action and become advocates for system change. The full power of a business comes when every employee feels supported and empowered to use their own voice to take a stand on the issues they care about — both inside the business through the decisions they make in their work as well as externally in their own social and community circles.
For example, Natura’s “The Future is in Your Hands” campaign was launched on World Amazon Day, a critical period leading up to the 2022 Brazilian elections. This campaign mobilized employees as well as the wider public to take action to protect the Amazon. The business also developed a “conscious vote” campaign for the network of approximately 2 million consultants and representatives of the Natura and Avon brands, most of whom are women. João Paulo Ferreira, CEO of Natura &Co Latin America, explained, “Research shows us that female voters are more reluctant to participate in the election. On the other hand, they wish to be better informed to make their own decisions, and we know the power of women to influence their families and communities.”
Activism
While many company leaders may feel uncomfortable engaging with or showing support for social movements, bringing a business voice to the table can make a big difference in protecting the human rights of the most vulnerable and marginalized in society.
For example, Ecosia sponsors “Climate Cafes,” where young people can turn eco-anxiety into action organized by the youth-led movement Force of Nature. As part of their global activism strategy, Natura &Co brand The Body Shop is taking a long-term view and advocating for policy and legislation change that allows for greater youth participation in politics and public life. And Patagonia regularly holds “Tools” conferences to teach campaign, social media, publicity, and fundraising skills to strengthen small, grassroots NGOs.
Allyship
Governments around the world are falling short of protecting the most vulnerable. Businesses must play a crucial role in correcting the current trajectory by placing people, justice, and human rights at the center of climate action — civil society and youth movements alone can’t do it and shouldn’t need to.
All three of our companies have dedicated strategies focused on listening, supporting, and amplifying the voices of indigenous communities, be they in the Amazon, where Natura is working with 40 local and traditional communities, or the Atlantic Forest, where Ecosia is working with PACTO Mata Atlântica, an umbrella organization of more than 300 tree-planting projects.
. . .
As you develop your advocacy strategy, be aware of the barriers you’re likely to come up against. Some people will challenge the role of business in engaging in the democratic systems that guide policy making. That’s valid, but with governments struggling to keep within climate targets, progressive businesses leaders who are themselves committed to net-zero and beyond must hold governments and large polluters accountable and ensure net-zero targets are enshrined in robust policies, regulations, and laws."
"To develop a proper understanding of the risks facing indebted African countries, international financial institutions must overhaul their own methods for assessing debt sustainability. Rather than setting arbitrary limits on a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio, the focus must shift to how debt is being used.
Such worries are nothing new. By the 1980s and 1990s, African countries had amassed debt largely by borrowing from official creditors such as development banks, OECD export credit agencies, and Paris Club lenders (major creditor countries). This set them apart from Latin American countries, which had borrowed heavily from private lenders. Still, rising debt-sustainability concerns led to a wave of debt-relief programs from the late 1990s through the 2000s.
In 1996, the IMF and the World Bank launched the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which was followed three years later by the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Both were major innovations in development finance that allowed for debts to multilateral creditors to be canceled. Then came the 2006 Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and the rescheduling of sovereign debts through the Paris Club, which created a sense of optimism about the future of Africa’s debt burdens. Official creditors had extended more than $100 billion in relief to more than 40 countries – some 85% of them in Africa.
More recently, the G20 established the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (in May 2020) and then the Common Framework for Debt Treatments (in November 2020) to help indebted countries deal with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Under these programs, all G20 and Paris Club creditors agreed to coordinate debt relief on a case-by-case basis to countries that applied for it.
The results, however, have been disappointing. Very few governments have applied for relief, fearing that the stigma would lock them out of global credit markets in the future. Yet tightening global financial and monetary conditions have only made matters worse, especially for countries with US dollar-denominated debts. The United Nations Development Program warns that 52 low- and middle-income countries are now in debt distress or at risk of it – and many of these are in Africa.
The Anatomy of African Economies
Debates over sovereign debt often link indebtedness with poor governance or gross incompetence, as if debt is something shameful that any “good” government would seek to avoid. And yet, as Barry Eichengreen and his co-authors argue in their book In Defense of Public Debt, “governments’ ability to issue debt has played a critical role in addressing national emergencies – from wars and pandemics to economic and financial crises, as well as in funding essential public goods and services such as transportation, education, and healthcare.” More fundamentally, “the capacity to issue debt has been integral to both state building and state survival. Public debt securities have contributed to the development of private financial markets and, through this channel, to modern economic growth.”

While excessive spending and misuse of public funds have certainly been a problem in some African countries, the financial fragility found on the continent is mainly the result of balance-of-payments deficits caused by external factors. For example, recessions in the few advanced economies that import goods from African countries tend to have an outsize impact on the latter cohort’s fiscal position. These African economies are heavily dependent on the export of one or two primary commodities, and they have struggled to diversify their trade partners.
Higher global energy prices also tend to cut deeply into African public finances – including even in the major oil-producing countries, owing to their lack of refining capacity. Similarly, African countries are acutely vulnerable to commodity-price swings, dollar exchange-rate fluctuations, and rising interest rates in major economies (which can substantially limit their access to financial markets). All these factors are well beyond African governments’ control.
These problems are compounded by the continent’s rapid population growth, which is increasing demand for public services. Moreover, African countries have large infrastructure gaps. The AfDB estimates that the continent’s infrastructure needs amount to $130-$170 billion per year, with a financing gap in the range of $68-$108 billion.
Africa therefore has a good reason for its large external debt: it needs such financing to pay for major investments in infrastructure (energy, water, telecommunications, and road networks) and human capital (health care and education) required by the continent’s rapid demographic growth. Increases in public and external debt thus can be justified, especially if they go toward investments that will increase potential growth and attract more foreign direct investment (FDI).
A Better Way
The many debt-relief schemes implemented since 1996 have failed because they have all been based on a flawed framework for debt-sustainability analysis in Africa. The traditional DSA is a rather simplistic accounting tool that focuses solely on a country’s financing needs and its ability to repay – or what is misleadingly known as a country’s overall “balance sheet.” The problem with this approach is that it over-emphasizes external assets and liabilities encompassing both the public and the private sector.
Abiding by this definition of an overall balance sheet, the IMF and the World Bank have long focused on debt-related liabilities (as opposed to equity) and reserves. Their justification is that a country’s external debt and reserves have a significant impact on its ability to discharge external obligations – which may result from a problem of either solvency or liquidity – and thus will determine its overall debt vulnerability.
But a better approach is to move beyond a narrow, rigid understanding of debt sustainability to get a fuller picture of the determinants of indebtedness and debt-servicing capacity on the continent – especially in natural resource-rich countries. If solvency is defined as a country’s ability to meet the present value of its external obligations, a broader view of public wealth should be considered, in addition to granular assessments of public-sector balance sheets. This would allow for a comprehensive evaluation of what the state owns and owes, thus offering a broader and more accurate fiscal picture beyond debt and deficits.
Once governments understand the size and nature of public assets, they can start managing them more effectively, with the potential to raise considerable additional revenue. A deeper analysis of public-sector balance sheets also would allow for better risk management and policymaking. The IMF’s Fiscal Monitor already provides governments with the tools to analyze the resilience of public finances. By identifying risks within the balance sheet, they can take steps to manage or mitigate them early, rather than dealing with the consequences after the fact.
What Has Been Missing
In 2018, the IMF and the World Bank finally acknowledged the weaknesses of their DSA framework, and introduced a new multi-pronged approach (MPA) that sought to strengthen debt transparency by working with borrowing countries and creditors to produce better public-sector-debt data and to mitigate debt vulnerabilities. The MPA also called for new tools to analyze debt developments and risks, and for reforms to the IMF and World Bank’s surveillance and lending policies to address debt risks and promote more efficient responses to debt crises.
The MPA represented a substantial improvement on the initial framework, but it still did not capture the specific economic identities of African countries. Since exports are these countries’ main engine of growth (owing to limited domestic demand), a realistic framework should account for the other macroeconomic and financial policies that are in place to boost external trade, promote economic and financial resilience, and reduce the volatility of export revenues.
Any DSA for Africa should place issues relating to external competitiveness and the appropriateness of exchange-rate policies at its core, to allow for a proper evaluation of national-currency overvaluation and devaluation in the medium term. Likewise, the analysis should consider a monetary policy’s capacity to provide a supply response in case of a currency devaluation.
DSA frameworks traditionally have not recognized the importance of the exchange-rate regime, even indirectly. While all countries should generally avoid excessive debt-service obligations, the risks and constraints are heightened for countries with a pegged exchange rate, especially when the anchor is a strong currency like the euro, which is the case for the 14 Sub-Saharan African countries in the CFA franc zone. For these countries, currency fluctuations have enormous implications for external debt, export revenue, employment creation, government revenue, and public debt.
Current analyses of debt sustainability do acknowledge the importance of reserves – which allow a country to absorb the shocks of curtailed or costly borrowing, boost confidence in its commitment to the timely discharge of external obligations, and support the value of its domestic currency. But even for countries with generally good macroeconomic management, a substantial volume of reserves is not a sufficient safety net in the case of sudden crises or financial contagion. Hence, a more effective DSA for African countries (and for developing countries more generally) would identify the critical element of their structural economic vulnerability – namely, their weak export structure (reliance on a few commodities and limited diversification of trade partners).
Finally, traditional DSA frameworks do not account well for security, even though this is a widespread issue on the continent, with significant macroeconomic implications. African countries at all levels of development are facing myriad security risks that carry major economic costs. While security budgets are usually state secrets, it is safe to assume that a substantial portion of fiscal revenue in many countries is now going to fight armed jihadist and rebel groups such as Boko Haram, Al-Shabab, and others.
These kinds of sustained security shocks incur heavy costs. Armed conflicts, civil wars, and terrorism destroy physical, human, and social capital, which in turn negatively affects production, trade, exports, consumption, and governments’ ability to collect adequate revenue to finance public expenditures. When military spending rises, social spending falls.
Armed conflicts are bad for business. They create unacceptably high levels of uncertainty (particularly for private-sector investment), fuel capital flight, and depress savings. Even after a conflict has ended, boosting investment remains difficult, because much of the necessary capital will have been damaged or destroyed. The harmful economic effects of conflict and war can last for years – or generations – undercutting growth and a country’s ability to service its debt. It is therefore critical that development-finance institutions devise new, credible financing instruments to support African countries confronted with exogenous security shocks, without worsening their capacity to service their debt.
New Urgency
To be sure, concerns about Africa’s rising public-debt levels (both external and domestic) should not be downplayed or treated with complacency. Given the global rise of nominal interest rates and the heightened volatility and downward trends for commodity prices, African countries may find it difficult to service the debts they accumulated during the last expansionary period. As such, they will struggle to maintain the elevated levels of government investment needed to sustain growth and structural transformations in the years ahead.
But this means that complementing the traditional, flawed DSA approach with alternative methods has become an urgent priority. We need a new process that accounts for additional information on a country’s debt trajectory, and that offers new policy levers to address debt concerns – such as through exchange-rate adjustments or a rebalancing of public investment.
Given African countries’ serious infrastructure gaps, limited public services, and persistent security issues, debt will remain an indispensable financing tool. To the extent that it is used to fund productivity-enhancing public infrastructure, it can be fully justified. Under plausible assumptions, infrastructure improvements can increase growth enough eventually to decrease the higher debt-to-GDP ratio that results from the initial financing. The role that such investments play in boosting FDI – and the role that FDI then plays in boosting growth – should be considered fully in any DSA.
Development institutions and rating agencies should focus more on the quality and proper uses of debt to finance inclusive growth and essential investments. Rather than setting arbitrary limits on a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio, the focus of monitoring institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank should be on assessing whether increases in Africa’s public debt are being used for the right purposes – namely, public infrastructure. This alone would go a long way toward reassuring investors and decreasing spreads.

CAMBRIDGE – Across Africa, macroeconomic management has improved substantially in recent years. Studies by the International Monetary Fund, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the World Bank, as well as surveys from Worldwide Governance Indicators and Transparency International, all attest to this trend. Yet concerns about debt sustainability on the continent have been mounting, especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Any DSA for Africa should place issues relating to external competitiveness and the appropriateness of exchange-rate policies at its core, to allow for a proper evaluation of national-currency overvaluation and devaluation in the medium term. Likewise, the analysis should consider a monetary policy’s capacity to provide a supply response in case of a currency devaluation.
DSA frameworks traditionally have not recognized the importance of the exchange-rate regime, even indirectly. While all countries should generally avoid excessive debt-service obligations, the risks and constraints are heightened for countries with a pegged exchange rate, especially when the anchor is a strong currency like the euro, which is the case for the 14 Sub-Saharan African countries in the CFA franc zone. For these countries, currency fluctuations have enormous implications for external debt, export revenue, employment creation, government revenue, and public debt.
Current analyses of debt sustainability do acknowledge the importance of reserves – which allow a country to absorb the shocks of curtailed or costly borrowing, boost confidence in its commitment to the timely discharge of external obligations, and support the value of its domestic currency. But even for countries with generally good macroeconomic management, a substantial volume of reserves is not a sufficient safety net in the case of sudden crises or financial contagion. Hence, a more effective DSA for African countries (and for developing countries more generally) would identify the critical element of their structural economic vulnerability – namely, their weak export structure (reliance on a few commodities and limited diversification of trade partners).
Finally, traditional DSA frameworks do not account well for security, even though this is a widespread issue on the continent, with significant macroeconomic implications. African countries at all levels of development are facing myriad security risks that carry major economic costs. While security budgets are usually state secrets, it is safe to assume that a substantial portion of fiscal revenue in many countries is now going to fight armed jihadist and rebel groups such as Boko Haram, Al-Shabab, and others.
These kinds of sustained security shocks incur heavy costs. Armed conflicts, civil wars, and terrorism destroy physical, human, and social capital, which in turn negatively affects production, trade, exports, consumption, and governments’ ability to collect adequate revenue to finance public expenditures. When military spending rises, social spending falls.
Armed conflicts are bad for business. They create unacceptably high levels of uncertainty (particularly for private-sector investment), fuel capital flight, and depress savings. Even after a conflict has ended, boosting investment remains difficult, because much of the necessary capital will have been damaged or destroyed. The harmful economic effects of conflict and war can last for years – or generations – undercutting growth and a country’s ability to service its debt. It is therefore critical that development-finance institutions devise new, credible financing instruments to support African countries confronted with exogenous security shocks, without worsening their capacity to service their debt.
New Urgency
To be sure, concerns about Africa’s rising public-debt levels (both external and domestic) should not be downplayed or treated with complacency. Given the global rise of nominal interest rates and the heightened volatility and downward trends for commodity prices, African countries may find it difficult to service the debts they accumulated during the last expansionary period. As such, they will struggle to maintain the elevated levels of government investment needed to sustain growth and structural transformations in the years ahead.
But this means that complementing the traditional, flawed DSA approach with alternative methods has become an urgent priority. We need a new process that accounts for additional information on a country’s debt trajectory, and that offers new policy levers to address debt concerns – such as through exchange-rate adjustments or a rebalancing of public investment.
Given African countries’ serious infrastructure gaps, limited public services, and persistent security issues, debt will remain an indispensable financing tool. To the extent that it is used to fund productivity-enhancing public infrastructure, it can be fully justified. Under plausible assumptions, infrastructure improvements can increase growth enough eventually to decrease the higher debt-to-GDP ratio that results from the initial financing. The role that such investments play in boosting FDI – and the role that FDI then plays in boosting growth – should be considered fully in any DSA.
Development institutions and rating agencies should focus more on the quality and proper uses of debt to finance inclusive growth and essential investments. Rather than setting arbitrary limits on a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio, the focus of monitoring institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank should be on assessing whether increases in Africa’s public debt are being used for the right purposes – namely, public infrastructure. This alone would go a long way toward reassuring investors and decreasing spreads."
"The Nokia G22 is a sub-$200 phone that you can fix yourself
You break it, you fix it.
What you need to know
- HMD Global announced the Nokia G22 at MWC 2023.
- This is a new budget phone coming to the market designed with repairability in mind.
- The company partnered with iFixit to provide tools and guides on how to repair the Nokia G22.
Mobile World Congress 2023 is coming to a close, but there's one device that still has us decently excited. The Nokia G22 has largely gone under the radar, considering there were plenty of foldables and concept phones that stole the show.
There's a very good chance that the Nokia G22 could be the phone that ends up selling the most. It's not that the specs will blow you away or anything, or that the G22 does something that the rest of the best cheap Android phones don't. But it's immediately apparent that the focus here is on sustainability and repairability.
HMD Global actually went so far as to partner with iFixit, in order to provide tools, guides, and the necessary parts so you can repair the G22 if something breaks. As it currently stands there are four different guides, walking you through the steps to replace the Back Cover, Battery, Charging Port Assembly, and Screen Assembly.

It's not so much that every phone should be able to be repaired by the person who owns it. But when a new phone is launched, and the parts are readily available, we can't help but think that it's another win for the ""right to repair"" initiative.
There aren't very many smartphones on the market that make repairs easy, with the only notable option being the Fairphone 4. And that's kind of the market that the Nokia G22 is entering, and the company aims to extend this easy repairability to future phones.
But the Nokia G22 has a bit of a better chance to succeed given that the Fairphone 4 is priced just below $600. Meanwhile, HMD Global is launching the Nokia G22 with a retail price of $179.
That being said, this is still a budget-friendly phone, and while repairs are possible, they might be a bit too much for some. For example, if you want to replace the Nokia G22's screen, the iFixit guide is comprised of a total of 39 different steps. But on the bright side, you won't need to worry about needing a specialized heat gun to remove the adhesive.
Of course, this isn't going to make waves in the same way that a similar phone made by Samsung would. But we're all for new devices that can be repaired, as one of these might just catch on and spark the change the market needs.

"Fill the bowl of lemons. Dust off the old purple tracksuit. Someone drive down to Big Yellow and get Danny Rose out of storage. Lay palm leaves across Hotspur Way, let the bells ring out across Enfield, make a small summer transfer budget available and prepare for the return of the chosen.
Perhaps it really will be that simple. The great travel writer Bill Bryson once observed that there were three things you can’t do in life. You can’t beat the phone company. You can’t get a waiter to see you until he’s ready to see you. And you can’t go home again. For the past few months – and very possibly the next few as well – Tottenham fans have been vocally challenging the wisdom of number three.
You could hear it in the concourses of Molineux as they slunk out after another dispiriting away defeat. “He’s magic, you know, Mauricio Pochettino,” they sang: an aspirin of the past to soothe the migraines of the present. For a few stirring minutes on the outskirts of Wolverhampton Spurs fans were no longer troubled by their gummed-up 3-4-3 or their curious inability to win second balls in their own penalty area. They were dreaming again.
And, on the face of it, has a prospective appointment ever felt more intrinsically right? Pochettino has been out of work since being sacked by Paris Saint‑Germain last summer and still has a house in north London. Spurs are drifting away on a tide of apathy, inertia and hopeful punts up the touchline. Antonio Conte has become so disillusioned with the job that even his gall bladder is telling him to get out of there. There will almost certainly be a vacancy in the summer and an acute shortage of suitable candidates. Chairman Daniel Levy wants to build bridges with the fanbase. Everything here points in one direction. Call the lawyers. This thing is as good as done.
At which point, and with apologies, it is necessary to take a breath, sit down and have a proper think about this: 2 Poch 2 Tottenham, how might this movie play out in practice? Well, for starters Pochettino would be welcomed back into the building like a freed political prisoner. After the tempestuousness of the José Mourinho era, the joylessness of the Conte era, the slapstick weirdness of the Nuno Espírito Santo era, Pochettino’s return would provide an immediate infusion of vigour.
Which is obviously a start. Perhaps the defining characteristic of Spurs of late is not so much failure or ineptitude but a kind of temple-scrunching surliness: a club that have essentially spent three and a half years in a bit of a grump. It is why they are still capable of spectacular outbursts: the win over Manchester City, the romp against Leicester, the late triumph against Marseille. But none of this is sustainable because ultimately, nobody really believes in its sustainability. Pochettino, with his energy-giving bowl of lemons, is a believer to his bones. This is a man who thought he could get Neymar to press. Lack of faith will not be an issue here.
But the problem with trying to reanimate the sensations and symbols of the past is that no two situations are ever truly comparable. The fleeting magic that Pochettino and his players conjured was the product of a particular time and a unique set of circumstances: a young and hungry team that had no body of work to defend, no reputation to protect, no expectations to meet, and who could thus write a new and thrilling page together.
What remains of that famous team beyond names and faces? Eric Dier bears the haunted melancholy of a nightwatchman guarding a deserted factory at 3am: strolling around glumly with his hands clasped behind his back, boots crunching on broken glass. Son Heung-min looks like a guy who has walked into the wrong wedding and is trying to play it casual. Hugo Lloris has reinvented himself as a surreal French mime act. Harry Kane seems to be there more out of politeness than anything. Even Pochettino is probably a different coach from the one Tottenham signed almost a decade ago: a little more weathered and crumpled, a little more pragmatic and proud, a coach for whom this job would probably be seen as a step down.
Alternatively, let’s say Levy gives Pochettino the clout and the war chest he should have given him in 2018, lets him rip things up and start again with a new group of players unscarred by the Passchendaele‑football of Mourinho and Conte. So, who? Where is the next Kane lurking in the academy? Who is the next Dele Alli waiting to be plucked from League One obscurity, and how do you keep him out of the clutches of a Newcastle or Chelsea? In short: is any of this grounded in anything more tangible than a touching nostalgia and the seductive emotional heft of a 2019 Amsterdam cosplay?
Tottenham’s biggest error over the past few years has been a tendency to keep fighting the last war: a car constantly U-turning on itself, grasping at a long-evaporated vision of the past, trying to protect what it has. The real lesson of the 2014-19 years, surely, was the value of a fresh start, fresh ideas, fresh ideals. Who is the modern equivalent of the 2014 Pochettino? At some point Levy – and Spurs fans – need to consider the possibility that it is probably not Pochettino any more."
